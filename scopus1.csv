Research objectives are to examine the associations of consumer's perception of color and brand logo possible influences and the evolution of that perception. The results of data analyses shows that the three hypotheses in which consumers will apply conventional color associations to the color of a brand's logo; consumers will apply personality traits to a brand, using color in the brand's logo, and consumers view brand logo as more appropriate when brand personality and color associations are congruent. Data analyses further reveals that customers tend to associate colors with personality traits that would affect their perception towards a brand and its logo within the South-East Asian context. © 2021 IEEE.",branding; Communications; reasoning and perception; South-East Asia,Brand recognition; Branding; Color association; Consumer perception; Consumer view; Malaysia; Personality traits; Reasoning and perception; Research objectives; Southeast Asia; Color,,,,,,,"Bottomley P.A., Doyle J.R., The interactive effects of color s and products on perceptions of brand logo appropriateness, Marketing Theory, 6, 63, pp. 63-83, (2006); Andrews J., Smith D., In search of the marketing imagination, factors affecting the creativity of marketing programs for mature products.

We explore how several technologies at the union of retail intelligence and smart city monitoring could coalesce into retail high streets that are both smart and sentient. We examine the new vantages that smart and sentient retail high streets provide on the customer journey, and how they could transform retailers’ sway over customer experience with new reach to the public spaces around shops. In doing so, we pursue a three-way consideration of these issues, examining the technology that underpins smart retailing, new advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning that beget a level of street-side sentience, and opportunities for retailers to map the knowledge that those technologies provide to individual customer journeys in outdoor settings. Our exploration of these issues takes form as a review of the literature and the introduction of our own research to prototype smart and sentient retail systems for high streets. The topic of enhancing retailers’ acuity on high streets has significant currency, as many high street stores have recently been struggling to sustain custom. However, the production and application of smart and sentient technologies at hyper-local resolution of the streetscape conjures some sobering considerations about shoppers’ and pedestrians’ rights to privacy in public. © 2022 by the author.",augmented reality; customer journey; deep learning; retail; sensing,,,,,,,,"Yorke T., Greenwood J., The same, The Smile.

In face of saturated social market and fierce competition among major platforms, how to compete for limited new users, increase user loyalty and decrease user churn has become a key issue for social platforms. All social platforms are conducting data analysis to understand their user groups, excavate user demand, and carry out refined operations. This paper divides users of a social platform from the perspective of user value. Firstly, the user value measurement indicator system is constructed, and data is collected and preprocessed. Then according to the pyramid model, the whole users are divided into three groups including high-value user layer, mid-value user layer and low-value user layer. High-value users are composed of SSR users who are the core users of the social platform. They play an important role in creating the platform's atmosphere and promoting platform. Then clustering analysis is carried out on mid-value user layer and low-value user layer based on K-means clustering algorithm. Each layer gets 4 clusters, and each cluster has its own characteristics. By constructing group profiles, we analyze group characteristics and differences between groups. Lastly, refined operation suggestions are put forward based on user characteristics so that enterprises can allocate resources reasonably. © 2022 The Authors.

Optimizing the elements included in these messages can help capture consumers’ attention and achieve a higher click-through rate on the ads. The main objective of this work is to analyse the awareness that different advertisements achieve. Specifically, we use a 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design where we manipulate the packaging format (single bottle vs. pack), labelling (bottle without label vs. labelled bottle) for wine ads (white and red). To analyse attention, we used an eye-tracking methodology. The main results suggest that attention is captured more quickly with an individual bottle without a label than with a particular bottle with a label in Google ads. However, ads showing packs of bottles with labels get more attention than ads using packs of bottles without labels. © 2021 by the authors.

With the advent of one-customer strategies, especially in e-commerce, traditional mass marketing in this area is becoming increasingly obsolete as customer-specific targeting becomes realizable. Such a strategy makes it essential to develop an underlying understanding of the interests and motivations of the individual customer. One method frequently used for this purpose is segmentation, which has evolved steadily in recent years. The aim of this paper is to provide a structured overview of the different segmentation methods and their current state of the art. For this purpose, we conducted an extensive literature search in which 105 publications between the years 2000 and 2022 were identified that deal with the analysis of customer behavior using segmentation methods. Based on this paper corpus, we provide a comprehensive review of the used methods. In addition, we examine the applied methods for temporal trends and for their applicability to different data set dimensionalities. Based on this paper corpus, we identified a four-phase process consisting of information (data) collection, customer representation, customer analysis via segmentation and customer targeting. With respect to customer representation and customer analysis by segmentation, we provide a comprehensive overview of the methods used in these process steps. We also take a look at temporal trends and the applicability to different dataset dimensionalities. In summary, customer representation is mainly solved by manual feature selection or RFM analysis. The most commonly used segmentation method is k-means, regardless of the use case and the amount of data. It is interesting to note that it has been widely used in recent years. © 2023, The Author(s).",Customer relationship management; Customer segmentation; Customer targeting; Feature engineering; RFM-analysis,,,,,,Bergische Universität Wuppertal,,"Abbasimehr H., Shabani M., A new framework for predicting customer behavior in terms of RFM by considering the temporal aspect based on time series techniques, J Ambient Intell Hum Comput, 12, 1, pp. 515-531, (2021);

This study explores the roles of influencers, informational incentives and fear of missing out (FoMO) in the relationships between social commerce platform use and consumer mental health. Data were obtained through questionnaires, as well as constructing a research model. Statistical analysis and path analysis of the structural equation model were performed by the software IBM SPSS and AMOS, and the following results were obtained. (1) Influencer expertise and interactivity, informational incentives and FoMO have a significant impact on consumers’ continued use of social commerce platforms. (2) Materialism has no significant effect on consumer social commerce platform use. (3) FoMO mediates the relationships between informational incentives and continued use of social commerce platforms. (4) Consumers’ continuous use of social commerce platforms has a strong relationship with mental health.

Using the current Web server log standard, which indicates only the locations of served Web pages, may lead to inaccurate business analysis for data driven and frequently updated static content Web pages. A properly defined Web content usage data warehouse that captures both dynamic and static contents of web pages provides rich data source for discovering interesting business rules among users' activities. This paper demonstrates the simplicity of data extract, transform and load procedures to import raw Web content usage log to various data models for data analysis, reporting and data mining tools. In this paper, we use two data mining techniques (expected maximization and the prefixspan algorithms) for visitor grouping and path analysis to find interesting patterns in Web content usage log data, an important component of e-commerce Web sites traffic analysis. Visitor grouping uses data clustering to group visitors/sessions with similar selected attributes' value. Path analysis mines common visiting path sequence. The ultimate goal is to enable the online merchant provide enhanced and differentiated marketing services generally to its existing and potential customers and tell what items customers are interested in instead of ambiguous URLs. © 2021 The Authors.

Chinese governments at different administrative levels have established official rumor-refuting accounts on social media to confute rumors, but the spread of rumors in social networks remains a significant concern due to the immature construction of rumor-refuting accounts. To identify the deficiencies of official rumor-refuting accounts at different administrative levels and how to improve their rumor-confutation ability, this paper applies a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method to evaluate Chinese official rumor-refuting accounts on social media, then discusses the differences among them to provide targeted suggestions for improvement. Based on the 10,253 rumor-refuting articles published by 26 Chinese official rumor-refuting accounts on WeChat (a combined social media of Twitter and WhatsApp in China) in 2021, this paper first proposes a targeted rumor-refuting ability evaluation criteria system based on Source-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) theory of communication. Then it applies the Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis-Analytic Hierarchy Process Sort-II with intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (SMAA-AHPSort-II-ITFN) method to evaluate and compare the official rumor-refuting accounts at different administrative levels. The evaluation results show significant differences in the ability of various rumor-refuting accounts to confute rumors. Finally, specific suggestions are provided for improving the ability of official rumor-refuting accounts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",MCDM; Official social media account; Rumor-confutation ability evaluation; Rumors in social networks; SMCR theory of communication; WeChat,Fuzzy sets; Social networking (online); Stochastic systems; Ability evaluation; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Official social medium account; Rumor in social network; Rumor-confutation ability evaluation; Social media; Source-message-channel-receiver theory of communication; Wechat; Decision making,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71801177, 72174134); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China, (18YJC630163)","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809] (grant numbers 71801177 ; 72174134 ), the Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China [http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013139] (grant number 18YJC630163) .

However, constantly and swiftly changing the customers’ interests and consumption behaviors make it inevitable to utilize sophisticated tools and approaches based on advanced technologies. Among them, by measuring the customers’ physiological and neural signals, studying the customers’ cognitive and affective responses to marketing stimuli, neuromarketing provides deep insight into the customers’ motivations, preferences, and decisions. Recently, the internet of everything (IoE) has brought many new opportunities to the industry and has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years. The main objective of this paper is to address how the IoE would empower neuromarketing techniques. Hence, an in-depth understanding of current research issues as well as emerging trends would help meet this goal. In this paper, a comprehensive review has been done by reviewing numerous journal and conference papers from various academic databases (sciencedirect.com, IEEE Xplore, Springer, Elsevier, Wiley, ACM digital library) based on applying various filtrations on specific keywords to identify and categorize the IoE devices in the neuromarketing field. In particular, we discussed the importance and the applications of IoE gadgets and devices, especially wearable medical technologies in eight neuromarketing techniques. Finally, we described critical existing challenges and limitations in neuromarketing and IoE gadgets that researchers have dealt with in this field of research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Consumer neuroscience;

This paper improves the original RFM model by including the potential loss to the hotel from a customer canceling their reservation in the indicator “Monetary” and adding a new indicator “Bonding” to indicate the degree of customer bonding with the hotel. The proposed model also includes the 2-tuple linguistic model to give hotel managers or decision-makers more easily understandable customer segmentation results. The aggregation of the four indicators (recency, frequency, monetary, and bonding) into a unique value is a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem. To generate the weights that can consider the relationship between various indicators and the level of data diversification contained in each indicator, the Entropy method and the CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method have been integrated. Customer overall values are generated based on the 2T-RFMB model and the integrated Entropy-CRITIC method. Finally, various customer segments are obtained with K-means clustering. This proposal has been evaluated by a real dataset from a hotel in Lisbon. The results show that the proposed model can increase the linguistic interpretability of clustering results. It also demonstrates that the proposed model can provide hotel managers with more realistic customer values to assist them in allocating their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) resources efficiently. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2-tuple linguistic model; CRITIC method; Customer segmentation; Customer value; Entropy method; Multi-criteria decision-making; RFM model,Decision making; K-means clustering; Linguistics; Public relations; Sales; 2-tuple linguistic models; Criteria importance through intercriteria correlation method; Customer values; Customers segmentations; Entropy criteria; Entropy methods; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; RFM model; Hotels,,,,,"Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Banco Santander, (CT58/21-CT59/21); Universidad Complutense de Madrid y el Banco Santander; V Plan Regional de Investigación Científica e Innovación Tecnológica; Universidad Complutense de Madrid, UCM","Funding text 1: The author Ziwei Shu was supported by the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Banco Santander (Project CT58/21-CT59/21).

Although an extensive amount of research has been developed in B2C and B2B marketing context, few social media studies take a dive into potential linkages between external and internal marketing contexts in an industry specific paradigm. This study aims to bridge B2C and B2B social media marketing, by adopting the outside-in perspective as theoretical lens. Using a large-scale dataset, collected from a micro-blogging site, and consumer-oriented information assembled from multiple sources, we empirically examine the inter-relationship between firm-generated messages, consumer digital engagement, and firm sales performance in the movie industry. Theoretically, this study builds upon the outside-in perspective and extends the current knowledge of the outside-in perspective to the social media context. It also bridges the B2C and B2B marketing literature by demonstrating that the insight garnered from B2C social media interactions should be integrated into the B2B firm interactions, communications, and decision makings. Managerially, this study provides movie practitioners with important implications. © 2021",Big data analysis; Consumer digital engagement; Firm-generated content; Outside-in perspective; Social media,,,,,,"Solutions for Aging Societies, (GZ 1570); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (91546121)","This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number: 91546121 ] and Digital Transformation in China and Germany: Strategies, Structures and Solutions for Aging Societies [grant number: GZ 1570 ].","Agnihotri R., Dingus R., Hu M.Y., Krush M.T., Social media: Influencing custome satisfaction in B2B sales, Industrial Marketing Management, 53, pp. 172-180, (2016); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Akpinar E., Berger J., Valuable virality, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 2, pp. 318-330, (2017); Alhabash S., McAlister A.R., Redefining virality in less broad strokes: Predicting viral behavioral intentions from motivations and uses of Facebook and twitter, New Media & Society, 17, 8, pp. 1317-1339, (2014); Alhabash S., McAlister A.R., Quilliam E.T., Richards J.I., Lou C., Alcohol's getting a bit more social: When alcohol marketing messages on Facebook increase young adults’ intentions to imbibe, Mass Communication and Society, 18, 3, pp. 350-375, (2015); Armstrong J.S., Persuasive advertising: Evidence-based principles, (2010); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative strategies in social media marketing: An exploratory study of branded social content and consumer engagement, Psychology and Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Berger J., Milkman K.L., What makes online content viral?, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Berger J., Schwartz E.M., What drives immediate and ongoing word of mouth?, Journal of Marketing Research, 48, 5, pp. 869-880, (2011); Bill F., Feurer S., Klarmann M., Salesperson social media use in business-to-business relationships: An empirical test of an integrative framework linking antecedents and consequences, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 4, pp. 734-752, (2020); Brennen R., Croft R., The use of social media in B2B marketing and branding: An exploratory study, Journal of Customer Behaviour, 11, 2, pp. 101-115, (2012); Calder B.J., Isaac M.S., Malthouse E.C., Taking the customer's point-of-view: Engagement or satisfaction?, (2013); Calder B.J., Malthouse E.C., Schaedel U., An experimental study of the relationship between online engagement and advertising effectiveness, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 23, 4, pp. 321-331, (2009); Cameron A.C., Trivedi P.K., Count panel data, (2013); Cao D., Meadows M., Wong D., Xia S., Understanding consumers' social media engagement behaviour: An examination of the moderation effect of social media context, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 835-846, (2021); Chen K., Yin J., Information competition in product launch: Evidence from the movie industry, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 26, pp. 81-88, (2017); Chen Z., Berger J., When, why, and how controversy causes conversation, Journal of Consumer Research, 40, 3, pp. 580-593, (2013); Chevalier J.A., Mayzlin D., The effect of word of mouth on sales: Online book reviews, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 3, pp. 345-354, (2006); Choudhary V., Currim I., Dewan S., Jeliazkow I., Mintz O., Turner J., Evaluation set size and purchase: Evidence from a product search engine, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 37, pp. 16-31, (2017); Colicev A., Kumar A., O'Connor P., Modeling the relationship between firm and user generated content and the stages of the marketing funnel, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 36, 1, pp. 100-116, (2019); Colicev A., Malshe A., Pauwels K., O'Connor P., Improving consumer mindset metrics and shareholder value through social media: The different roles of owned and eared media, Journal of Marketing, 82, 1, pp. 37-56, (2018); Cortez R.M., Johnston W.J., The future of B2B marketing theory: A historical and prospective analysis, Industrial Marketing Management, 66, pp. 90-102, (2017); Coulter K.S., Punj G.N., The effects of cognitive resource requirements, availability, and argument quality on brand attitudes: A melding of elaboration likelihood and cognitive resource matching theories, Journal of Advertising, 33, 4, pp. 53-64, (2004); Coursaris C.K., Van Osch W., Balogh B.A., Informing brand messaging strategies via social media analytics, Online Information Review, 40, 1, pp. 6-24, (2016); Darke P.R., Ritchie R.J.B., The defensive consumer: Advertising deception, defensive processing, and distrust, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, 1, pp. 114-127, (2007); Das G., Wiener H.J., Kareklas I., To emoji or not to emoji?

In consumer markets, such programmes do little to influence behavioural loyalty and disproportionately attract the firm's existing heavy buyers. Industrial buying, however, relies on direct sales channels and features negotiation and reciprocity. Loyalty effects may therefore differ in B2B, and although no clear picture yet exists, such knowledge is important as B2C digital loyalty programmes grow in popularity. Here, the authors describe programme membership's evolving characteristics over in a B2B scheme that was launched in the US metal-cutting tools manufacturer customer base. Findings are consistent with the idea that the scheme recruited the heaviest buyers earliest and had an insignificant effect on total revenue. The authors discuss managerial implications, particularly about (1) managing the rollout of similar schemes and (2) refocussing on the programme objectives to maintain sales from the lightest rather than the heaviest buyers. © 2021, IGI Global.",nan,,,,,,,,"Abrell T., Pihlajamaa M., Kanto L., Vom Brocke J., Uebernickel F., The role of users and customers in digital innovation: Insights from B2B manufacturing firms, Information & Management, 53, 3, pp. 324-335, (2016); Abubakar A.M., Elrehail H., Alatailat M.A., Elci A., Knowledge management, decisionmaking style and organisational performance, Journal of Innovation & Knowledge, 4, 2, pp. 104-114, (2019); Ailawadi K.L., Borin N., Farris P.W., Market power and performance: A cross-industry analysis of manufacturers and retailers, Journal of Retailing, 71, 3, pp. 211-248, (1995); Aman A., Understanding and managing 'internal'and 'external'channel conflict in African markets: Learnings from Pakistan, Abasyn University Journal of Social Sciences, 10, 1, (2017); Armario J.M., Ruiz D.M., Armario E.M., Market orientation and internationalisation in small and medium-sized enterprises, Journal of Small Business Management, 46, 4, pp. 485-511, (2008); Armstrong G., Kotler P., Opresnik M.O., Marketing: An Introduction, (2011); Arnould E., Linda P., Zinkhan G.M., Consumers, (2003); Atieno O.P., An analysis of the strengths and limitation of qualitative and quantitative research paradigms, Problems of Education in the 21st Century, 13, 1, pp. 13-38, (2009); Berry M.A., Rondinelli D.A., Proactive corporate environmental management: A new industrial revolution, The Academy of Management Perspectives, 12, 2, pp. 38-50, (1998); Bolton R.N., Kannan P.K., Bramlett M.D., Implications of loyalty program membership and service experiences for customer retention and value, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 28, 1, pp. 95-108, (2000); Breugelmans E., Bijmolt T.H., Zhang J., Basso L.J., Dorotic M., Kopalle P., Minnema A., Mijnlieff W.J., Wunderlich N.V., Advancing research on loyalty programs: A future research agenda, Marketing Letters, 26, 2, pp. 127-139, (2015); Brocato D., Push and pull marketing strategies.

It is clear that online marketing strategies do not need to replace offline marketing strategies and vice versa. The big challenge will be how both will remain complementary to solving each other's shortcomings in view of a marketing strategy. It becomes evident that the techniques complement each other, forming a more robust and complete marketing strategy, bringing more attention to the brand, and increasing the visibility of the company. Therefore, the online-to-offline (O2O) and customer-centric approach will be able to build a stronger reputation, which will generate customer loyalty. In this context, a systematic review of the bibliometric literature on the basis of SCOPUS indexation was carried out. This study aims to understand what are the future designs of O2O Marketing and how they will coexist in a marketing strategy. © 2023, IGI Global.

In the case of online advertising, performance metrics are fragmented in different campaigns and ad sets, making it difficult to compare customer segments. In this research, we present SiloSolver, an algorithm that (a) retrieves performance metrics for different customer segments across all campaigns, (b) aggregates the values for each customer segment in mean values, and (c) runs a statistical comparison (Student's t-Test) on the performance differences between the segments. The algorithm is evaluated using a real Facebook Ads dataset from an e-commerce company consisting of hundreds of campaigns from over five years. Using SiloSolver, advertisers using Facebook Ads are better able to understand their market segments across multiple seemingly disparate campaigns.  © 2021 IEEE.",customer segmentation; digital marketing; Facebook Ads; online advertising,Commerce; Sales; Automatic aggregations; Customers segmentations; Customers segments; Data silos; Digital marketing; Facebook; Facebook ads; Mean values; Online advertizing; Performance metrices; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Shapiro B.P., Bonoma T.V., How to Segment Industrial Markets, Harvard Business Review, (1984); Jiang T., Tuzhilin A., Segmenting Customers from Population to Individuals: Does 1-To-1 Keep Your Customers Forever?, Ieee Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 18, 10, pp. 1297-1311, (2006); Smith W.R., Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies, Journal of Marketing, 21, 1, pp. 3-8, (1956); Jansen B.J., Jung S., Ramirez Robillos D., Salminen J., Too Few, Too Many, Just Right: Creating the Necessary Number of Segments for Large Online Customer Populations, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, (2021); Jarvinen J., Karjaluoto H., The use of Web analytics for digital marketing performance measurement, Industrial Marketing Management, 50, pp. 117-127, (2015); Insider B., Facebook adds a million advertisers in 7 months, Business Insider, 12, (2017); Mahalle P.N., Shinde G.R., Pise P.D., Deshmukh J.Y., Data Collection and Preparation, Foundations of Data Science for Engineering Problem Solving, pp. 15-31, (2022); Clarke T.B., Jansen B.J., Conversion potential: A metric for evaluating search engine advertising performance, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 11, 2, pp. 142-159, (2017); Mustak M., Salminen J., Ple L., Wirtz J., Artificial intelligence in marketing: Topic modeling, scientometric analysis, and research agenda, Journal of Business Research, 124, pp. 389-404, (2021); Yang Y., Yang Y.C., Jansen B.J., Lalmas M., Computational Advertising: A Paradigm Shift for Advertising and Marketing?, Ieee Intelligent Systems, 32, 3, pp. 3-6; An J., Kwak H., Jung S., Salminen J., Jansen B.J., Customer segmentation using online platforms: Isolating behavioral and demographic segments for persona creation via aggregated user data, Social Network Analysis and Mining, 8, 1, (2018); Dickson P.R., Person-Situation: Segmentation?s Missing Link, Journal of Marketing, 46, 4, pp. 56-64, (1982); Firat A.F., Shultz C.J., From segmentation to fragmentation: Markets and marketing strategy in the postmodern era, European Journal of Marketing, 31, 3-4, pp. 183-207, (1997); Jenkinson A., Beyond segmentation, Journal of Targeting, Measurement and Analysis for Marketing, 3, 1, pp. 60-72, (1994); Jansen B.J., Moore K., Carman S., Evaluating the performance of demographic targeting using gender in sponsored search, Information Processing & Management, 49, 1, pp. 286-302, (2013); Jansen B.J., Salminen J.O., Jung S.-G., Data-Driven Personas for Enhanced User Understanding: Combining Empathy with Rationality for Better Insights to Analytics, Data and Information Management, 4, 1, pp. 1-17; Saggi M.K., Jain S., A survey towards an integration of big data analytics to big insights for value-creation, Information Processing & Management, 54, 5, pp. 758-790, (2018); An J., Kwak H., Salminen J., Jung S., Jansen B.J., Imaginary People Representing Real Numbers: Generating Personas from Online Social Media Data, Acm Transactions on the Web (TWEB, 12, 3, (2018); Jansen B., Salminen J., Jung S., Guan K., Data-Driven Personas, 1st Ed, 14; Agarwal R., Dhar V., Editorial-Big Data, Data Science, and Analytics: The Opportunity and Challenge for IS Research, Information Systems Research, 25, 3, pp. 443-448, (2014); Del Vecchio P., Mele G., Ndou V., Secundo G., Creating value from Social Big Data: Implications for Smart Tourism Destinations, Information Processing & Management, (2017); Salminen J., Milenkovic M., Jansen B.J., Problems of Data Science in Organizations: An Explorative Qualitative Analysis of Business Professionals?

Drawing on the theories of family businesses and consumer behavior, this paper investigates the relationship between the consumers’ perceptions of family-owned enterprises and their purchasing decisions. Using a question-naire, we surveyed 1069 young Polish consumers. Our findings demonstrate that young consumers’ convictions about family businesses are well-formed, despite their quite modest knowledge of these business entities. The vast majority of the survey participants were not able to provide any family business names. This implies that young consumers’ views on family businesses result from specu-lation or adoption of opinions that are dominant in a given society. To raise the level of awareness of their brands and transform consumers’ intentions into real purchasing behavior, family business entities need to intensify the educational significance of their promotional activities to help counteract the stereotypes about family businesses. The analysis presented here has important implications for current debates on whether the development of emotional relationships with family business entities and their brands is a suitable strategy to shape the purchasing attitudes towards the products made by family companies. The research findings could also form the basis for an extended study exploring what strategies family companies can implement in order to effectively shape young consumers’ perceptions about these firms. The research results can also serve as an aid for family firm owners and managers in rebuilding their client-oriented activities. The aforementioned knowledge can support family firm owners and managers in establishing effective marketing strategies. It also opens interesting avenues for further research. © 2022 by the authors.

Despite the fact that the issue of uncertainty in e-commerce has been extensively discussed, little is known about the mechanisms that customers of social commerce employ to lessen their perceptions of uncertainty. The role of various factors, including return policy leniency, information quality, seller popularity, seller reputation, and number of positive comments, in product uncertainty in social commerce is still little understood. Additionally, the social commerce literature indicates that more research is required on the mediating role of seller uncertainty. According to the empirical evidence from 471 customers, return policy leniency, information quality, seller popularity, seller reputation, and number of positive review comments all have significant negative effects on seller uncertainty. In addition, the results demonstrate that seller uncertainty partially mediates the relationships between these factors and customers’ perceptions of product uncertainty in social commerce. These findings reveal important implications for both practice and theory. © 2023 The Author(s)",Information quality; Product uncertainty; Seller popularity; Seller reputation; Seller uncertainty; Social commerce,,,,,,,,"Abdulla H., Abbey J.D., Ketzenberg M., How consumers value retailer's return policy leniency levers: An empirical investigation, Production and Operations Management, 31, 4, pp. 1719-1733, (2022); Abid A., Harrigan P., Roy S.K., Online relationship marketing through content creation and curation, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 38, 6, pp. 699-712, (2019); Ahmad S.Z., Ahmad N., Bakar A.R.A., Reflections of entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized enterprises concerning the adoption of social media and its impact on performance outcomes: Evidence from the UAE, Telematics and Informatics, 35, 1, pp. 6-17, (2018); Ahn J., Sura S., The effect of information quality on Social Networking Site (SNS)-Based commerce: From the perspective of Malaysian SNS users, Journal of Organizational and End User Computing (JOEUC), 32, 1, pp. 1-18, (2020); Akroush M.N., Al-Debei M.M., An integrated model of factors affecting consumer attitudes towards online shopping, Business Process Management Journal, 21, 6, pp. 1353-1376, (2015); Al-Adwan A.S., Revealing the influential factors driving social commerce adoption, Interdisciplinary Journal of Information, Knowledge, and Management, 14, pp. 295-324, (2019); Al-Adwan A.S., Al-Horani M.A., Boosting customer e-loyalty: An extended scale of online service quality, Information, 10, 12, (2019); Al-Adwan A.S., Al-Debei M.M., Dwivedi Y.K., E-commerce in high uncertainty avoidance cultures: The driving forces of repurchase and word-of-mouth intentions, Technology in Society, (2022); Al-Adwan A.S., Alrousan M.K., Yaseen H., Alkufahy A.M., Alsoud M., Boosting online purchase intention in high-uncertainty-avoidance societies: A signaling theory approach, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 8, 3, (2022); Aladwani A.M., A quality-facilitated socialization model of social commerce decisions, International Journal of Information Management, 40, pp. 1-7, (2018); Ali W.A., Mukhtar M., Mohamed I., Validating the factors influencing social commerce adoption in small and medium enterprise in Malaysia, Indones.

Fashion is a hot topic for both the general public and the social economy, so there is great potential for exploring and manipulating social media data for the development of the fashion industry in the current era. This paper aims to explore the current status of social media user behavior analysis applied to the fashion and apparel industry for advanced product development, branding strategy planning and the resolution of other decision-making problems in the big data context. First, articles were retrieved from the database ""Web of Science"". With the assistance of experts, 201 articles were determined for further study. Next, the evolution of hot topics within the domain was visualized and discussed through bibliometric analysis. Then, the application of social media data in the fashion domain was investigated, and common data mining methods were discussed. Finally, the paper summarized the development status of social media user behavior analysis (SMUBA) applied to the fashion and apparel industry and put forward the future prospect under the framework of mass customization in the big data era. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Big data; Demand mining; Fashion consumer behavior; Mass customization; Social media,clothing industry; data set; decision making; demand analysis; product development; social media; strategic approach,,,,,"Open Project of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Silk Engineering, (KJS 2057); University Grants Commission, UGC; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (22YJC760111)","Funding text 1: This work was funded by MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (grant number: 22YJC760111 ) and the Open Project of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Silk Engineering (grant number: KJS 2057 ).; Funding text 2: Sentiment analysis is primarily taken as classification tasks. The sentiment inclination of unlabelled data is recognized by extracting features (e.g., part of speech features, sentence structure, rhetorical devices, etc.) through ML modelling based on training datasets (Neethu and Rajasree, 2013). In Natural Language Processing (NLP), word embedding is one of the representative methods. It maps words into numerical values using neural networks for machine recognition and is widely applied to sentiment analysis (Bojanowski et al., 2017). Based on text recognition, measures should be taken to predict sentiment polarities, or classification. Commonly used ML classification algorithms used in sentiment analysis include ME (maximum entropy), Bagging, NB (naive Bayes), SVM (support vector machine), etc. Based on user comments about 83 luxury fashion brands collected from Facebook and their associated UGC, Dhaoui et al. (2017) compared lexicon-based method (LIWC 2015) and various ML classification algorithms including ME, Random Forests, SVM, Bagging, Decision Tree, etc. in sentiment analysis, and found that ME modelling has better performance in predicting positive sentiments while the Bagging method is better at predicting negative sentiments. Pantano (2018) used NB to analyze consumer interaction on social media, to understand the status of the British fast fashion industry. The ML algorithm based on SVM is widely used because of its advantages in high accuracy and low complexity. Romão et al. (2019) used SVM to study the attitudes and opinions of social media users on fashion brands.This work was funded by MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (grant number: 22YJC760111) and the Open Project of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Silk Engineering (grant number: KJS 2057).","Acharya A., Singh S.K., Pereira V., Singh P., Big data, knowledge co-creation and decision making in fashion industry, Int.

Significantly, customer insights with solid customer relationships improve customer retention and satisfaction, thereby contributing to profit. Thus, customer segmentation based on cluster analysis is critical to customer identification in CRM. In addition, it can identify the potential customers and their needs to be matched with marketing strategies. However, unfortunately, this approach has led to a gap between the marketing persons who care about the business implications and clustering output with the data science complexity barrier. Moreover, most clustering methodologies give only groups or segments, such that customers of each group have similar features without customer data relevance. Thus, this work sought to address these concerns by using a hierarchical approach. This research proposes a new effective clustering algorithm by combining Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) model with formal concept analysis (FCA). This new methodology uses the advantages of FCA in building the knowledge representation; therefore, the obtained construction contains both implicit and explicit knowledge. Explicit knowledge shows information represented in the hierarchical structure model, while implicit knowledge is embedded in the structure with its implication properties. Thus, the knowledge structure from FCA reveals relationships among data points in an easily understood manner. The proposed model was evaluated and compared with K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering using the online retail II dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed method provides enough and appropriate information for marketers to perceive the value of the clustering results for creating practical marketing strategies in real-world business by offering the marketers both customer segmentation and the relationships in customer data at the same time. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Clustering; Customer segmentation; Formal concept analysis; Hierarchical concept; RFM model,"Charge transfer; Competition; Customer satisfaction; Formal concept analysis; K-means clustering; Knowledge representation; Public relations; Sales; Strategic planning; Clusterings; Customer data; Customer relationship management; Customers segmentations; Formal concepts analysis; Hierarchical approach; Hierarchical concept; Implicit knowledge; Marketing strategy; Recency, frequency, and monetary model; Cluster analysis",,,,,"Faculty of Science and Industrial Technology; Office of Research and Development, ORD; Prince of Songkla University, PSU, (SIT6502069S)","Funding text 1: A novel approach that combines RFM analysis and FCA has been introduced, enabling customer relationships to be visualized through a Hasse diagram for a hierarchical concept. This methodology utilizes the FCA knowledge structure to extract implication rules, facilitating the discovery of knowledge relationships in customer segmentation, in contrast to K-means clustering, which only provides distinct customer groups without their relationships and implicit knowledge. The hierarchical clustering technique also completely separates customer groups and is associated with a hierarchically structured dendrogram. This innovative methodology primarily generates hierarchical overlapping clusters, meaning a customer may belong to more than one hierarchical concept or cluster. Moreover, FCA is supported by a strong mathematical theory, allowing for rigorous evaluation of the results. The outcomes of our approach indicate the actual incidents that occur in the dataset. The results of our proposed approach are presented in a clear and understandable way with the help of different visual aids, such as the sublattice in Fig. 6 and the hierarchical concepts in Fig. 7.The authors are deeply grateful to the Faculty of Science and Industrial Technology, Prince of Songkla University, Surat Thani Campus, Thailand.

Although evidence suggests that influencer live-streaming advertisements (ads) on social media can increase consumers’ buying impulses, little research examined how this similar but new advertising method on e-commerce platforms may influence consumers’ urge to buy impulsively. This study explores the role of influencer credibility, celebrity effect, perceived entertainment, trust and perceived usefulness on consumers’ attitudes toward influencer ads and their urge to buy impulsively. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire containing seven constructs was developed and distributed to participants using a convenient sample and snowball sampling approach. The constructs were measured based on validated measurement items from the literature and adjusted according to this study’s focus. A total of 236 valid responses were obtained from the survey and used for data analysis. A partial least squares structural equation modeling approach was employed for parameter estimation and model testing. Findings: The empirical results show that all constructs influenced consumers’ urge to buy impulsively via attitude toward influencer ads. The proposed research model explains 61.7% of the variance in attitude toward influencer ads and 19.4% of the urge to buy impulsively. Originality/value: This is an early study investigating the relationship between influencer advertising and impulse buying. The results provide valuable insights into improving the design of influencer ads and marketing strategies. Highlights: I-eIB model tests the mechanism of influencer ads on consumers’ buying impulse. Consumers’ attitude towards influencer ads affects their urge to buy impulsively. Influencer credibility affects consumer attitude via celebrity effect as a mediator. Trust affects consumer attitude via perceived usefulness as a mediator.

The study tests an empirical model based on the research variables and constructs identified using structural equation modeling and the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (FsQCA) approach. Data were collected from 278 food firms. The findings indicate that the implementation of an AI marketing strategy affects performance. Additionally, this study shows that marketing capabilities, customer value co-creation, and market orientation are positively related to performance. Finally, the results highlight that marketing capabilities, customer value co-creation, and market orientation affect the development of AI marketing strategies. The research results of FsQCA find that causal conditions of marketing capabilities, customer value co-creation, market orientation, and AI marketing strategy are necessary and sufficient recipes for higher firm performance. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",AI marketing strategy; artificial intelligence (AI); FsQCA; market orientation; performance,,,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (108‐2410‐H‐005‐054)","The authors acknowledge and are grateful for the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under grant 108‐2410‐H‐005‐054.

First, this paper reviews the existing literature regarding the use of data analytics methods and artificial intelligence algorithms in the e-marketing field. Then, the paper discusses how modern enterprises can benefit from these tools to efficiently deal with a myriad of marketing possibilities, including strategies they can use in order to fulfill their customers' needs or to generate new markets for their products and services. Several examples of real-life applications are analysed with the aim of illustrating the potential of these techniques. Finally, we use some statistical/machine learning techniques to perform a text mining analysis of a selected subset of scientific articles, which allows us to identify the main trends in the field.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",artificial intelligence; data analytics; e-marketing; machine learning,,,,,,,,"Abraham J., Septian D.L., Prayoga T., Ruman Y.S., Predictive factors of attitude towards online disruptive advertising, Strategies for Business Sustainability in a Collaborative Economy, pp. 102-121, (2020); Aggarwal C., Reddy C., Data Clustering: Algorithms and Applications, (2018); Alghizzawi M., The role of digital marketing in consumer behavior: a survey, Int.

The main objectives of the research are to demonstrate the viable way of making effective recommendations for optimizing the media strategy by modeling offline and online traffic to the stores based on econometric modeling and to develop a decision support system, which enhance the effective growth of business KPIs and an effective decision-making process. Econometric modeling, deeper data analysis, decision support were implemented on the data of one of the main retailers in Ukraine in a period before the full-scale Russian invasion. Estimating the impact of different communication channels on business results made basis for ROI calculations and optimization of media investments allocation among media channels by periods, video durations, type of advertising and with optimal weekly media pressure. ROMI calculation was based on the results of regression modeling, which estimate the level of traffic and sales generated by each media channel. The information-analytical decision support system based on an interactive dashboard has been developed for improvement of day-by-day business planning and management. The developed framework of regional strategy selection facilitates to the formation of a strategic vision on a regional scale and improves the quality of a regional media strategy. © 2023 The Author(s).",decision support system; interactive dashboard; Marketing mix modeling; regression analysis; traffic,,,,,,,,"Arkhipova T., Mechanism of optimization of advertising information channels, Marketing: theory and practice: Formation of the market economy, pp. 445-460, (2009); Cain P., Modelling short and long-term marketing effects in the consumer purchase journey, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 39, 1, pp. 96-116, (2021); Chantayarkul A., Ayuthaya S., Kiattisin S., The Marketing Strategy for Enhancing the Competitiveness of Local Traditional Stores in Thailand, 59th Annual Conference of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan, SICE 2020, pp. 602-607, (2020); Chenavaz R., Feichtinger G., Hartl R., Kort P., Modeling the impact of product quality on dynamic pricing and advertising policies, European Journal of Operational Research, 284, 3, pp. 990-1001, (2020); Chernyak O., Fareniuk Y., Modeling of Effectiveness of Media Investment Based on Data Science Technologies for Ukrainian Bank, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2732, pp. 282-289, (2020); Chornous G., Fareniuk Y., Marketing mix modeling for pharmaceutical companies on the basis of data science technologies, Access to science, business, innovation in digital economy, ACCESS Press, 2, 3, pp. 274-289, (2021); Dash M., Sharma K., Marketing Response Modelling: Impact of Digital Marketing for a Luxury Car Brand, Journal of Creative Communications, 14, 3, pp. 254-270, (2019); Deart V., Mankov V., Krasnova I., Traffic Flows Forecasting Based on Machine Learning, International Journal of Embedded and Real-Time Communication Systems, 13, 1, pp. 1-19, (2022); Grosul V., Askerov T., Modelling of a dynamic adaptation system of a retail enterprise, Včenì Zapiski Tavrìjs'kogo Nacìonal'nogo Unìversitetu Ìmenì V.Ì.

At the same time, the use of digital marketing as a communication and sales channel has led to the need and use of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to correctly manage company information. The understanding of B2B traditional Marketing strategies that use CRMs that work with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been studied, however, research focused on the understanding and application of these technologies in B2B digital marketing is scarce. To cover this gap in the literature, this study develops a literature review on the main academic contributions in this area. To visualize the outcomes of the literature review, the results are then analyzed using a statistical approach known as Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) under the homogeneity analysis of variance by means of alternating least squares (HOMALS) framework programmed in the R language. The research results classify the types of CRMs and their typologies and explore the main techniques and uses of AI-based CRMs in B2B digital marketing. In addition, a discussion, directions and propositions for future research are presented. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Artificial intelligence-based CRMs; B2B digital marketing; Multiple correspondence analysis;

Design/methodology/approach: This study carried out cluster analyses on a large sample (N = 9,065) from a nationwide survey on the use of information and communication technology in Brazil. Findings: Three clusters of e-commerce nonusers were identified: the first cluster is quite reluctant; the second is characterized by disbelief in e-commerce; and the last cluster includes members who must see a product to believe it. Overall, nonusers have different reasons not to shop online, but they also share some similarities in this regard. Furthermore, socioeconomic factors do not seem to affect their behavior. The findings suggest that merchants’ failure to attract customers’ attention and tangibility are the major barriers to e-commerce use. Practical implications: Even though nonusers have different reasons not to shop online, the key pattern that emerges is the value of tangibility for these individuals, which is a barrier present in all three clusters. This suggests that current marketing strategies and advertisements are ineffective to reach these consumers. Vendors should therefore try different approaches. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the information systems (IS) literature by bringing a new perspective to the understanding of e-commerce rejection in addition to having managerial implications that involve strategies to attract potential users based on their specificities. © 2023, Gabriel Nery-da-Silva, Marcelo Henrique de Araujo and Fernando de Souza Meirelles.",Consumer behavior; Electronic market; Non-shopper segmentation; Online shopping; Retailing; Shopping preference,,,,,,"Getulio Vargas Foundation’s São Paulo School of Business Administration; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","The authors thank J.

Consequently, mobile/cell phone waste has risen significantly in the last decade. Due to their small size, it is convenient for users to keep outdated or unused mobile phones at home or the office, rather than recycling them appropriately. A reverse supply chain (RSC) is one possible method of mitigating the questionable e-waste activity present in the ecosystem. RSC has been significant for the mobile phone industry, user states, analysts, and scholars. This paper reviews the available literature in the RSC management (RSCM) domain, along with its processes and strategies. The paper reviews 223 published scholarly papers in the domain of mobile phone waste recycling and investigates 22 papers related to factors influencing consumers’ intention with regard to electronic recycling, focusing on mobile devices, which contribute significantly to electronic waste management practices. © 2021 by the authors.

Brands can push advertisements of the same product from different sources to consumers in a targeted manner; however, the differences in the impact on consumers of TDA with different content sources are surprisingly understudied. Therefore, this study analyzes the consumers' purchase intentions in the context of TDA with different content sources (stars vs. bloggers vs. top e-commerce streamers), and the perceived differences between consumers with different thinking styles. Through two experimental studies, this study finds that TDA with top e-commerce streamers' recommendation source can better improve consumers' purchase intentions more than TDA with a star endorsement and TDA with a blogger evaluation. For consumers who prefer the rational thinking style, TDA with a star endorsement and TDA with top e-commerce streamers recommendation can be better; For consumers who prefer the empirical thinking style, TDA recommended by bloggers and TDA with top e-commerce streamers recommendation can be better. Furthermore, this study finds that consumers' mental simulation and perceived usefulness can mediate the relationships described above, and that the two play a chain mediation role. The findings contribute to the precision marketing literature by enriching the understanding of the psychological mechanism underlying consumers' perceptions of and decision factors toward the TDA. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",nan,,,,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities at East China Normal University, (2021QKT007);

Moreover, smartphones gave a new face with the emergence of mobile apps. Grocery apps are one of such applications that have created customized and finest shopping experiences for consumers today. The purpose of the paper is to highlight the underlying factors influencing a consumer’s behavioral intention (BI) to adopt and accept the technology (i.e., grocery apps). The unique constructs have been derived from potential models of technology acceptance. The paper investigated the effects and relationships of such factors in adoption of grocery apps and its actual usage. Thus, a general adoption model was evolved that provided a comprehensive understanding of the consumers’ intention to adopt the grocery apps and identify the level of its acceptance. Based on the insights from prior research, a new model has been developed. 440 respondents have provided their valuable responses.

We test the role of an augmented digital human stimulus as a moderator for storytelling satisfaction in a technology-enhanced retail complex. Building on visual perception theory and information processing theory, the findings from our study reveal sequential links between the four realms of experience economy theory in a mixed reality environment and subsequent effects on storytelling satisfaction, which in turn are boosted by digital human storytelling. Overall, our findings reveal that digital human storytelling is an effective long-term marketing strategy in technology-enhanced environments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality;

However, not all products are suitable to be sold online. Vegetables are one of the fresh agricultural products which are challenging to sell online due to the need to keep the products fresh. For instance, long shipping time and irregular temperature during transportation will result in the spoilage of the fresh agricultural products and lead to a decrease in interest among consumers and micro-farmer in Agri-Food E-Commerce (AE) involvement. This research identifies the factors for consumers to purchase fresh agricultural product online and identify the barriers faced by micro-farmer in AE adoption. This research also aims to study the relationship between online purchase intention and the adoption of AE in Malaysia. In this research, a multi-method design comprises interviews and questionnaire surveys. SPSS and Smart-PLS will be used as analysis tools for quantitative analysis while Nvivo will be used for qualitative analysis. This research is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge in AE by providing a basic understanding of the online purchase intention, adoption, and readiness of AE in Malaysia. In addition, a theoretical model of AE acceptance and adoption is designed. This research will promote insightful discussions and communication for the increasing participation and uptake among all fresh agricultural product producers and suppliers in AE. By providing insight into the balance of supply and demand for the fresh agricultural product via AE, food wastage (due to spoiled agricultural products) can be reduced, and the consumption and production pattern can be studied. © 2023 Author(s).",nan,,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2021/SS02/UTAR/02/1)",This research was supported by Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) through Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2021/SS02/UTAR/02/1).

The approach is demonstrated using data from a company selling nutritional supplements, consisting of approximately 130,000 records from six Central European countries. The analysis results in distinct groups of customers, which are proposed for more effective management of customer relationships. The findings have implications for retailers, helping them focus on the most profitable customer segments to increase sales and profits and build lasting relationships. Furthermore, cluster analysis proves to be an appropriate statistical method for classification and provides valuable insights into patterns and trends in the analysed data. Overall, this paper contributes to development and comparison of methods for customer segmentation and demonstrates their potential for improving economic efficiency and building long-term customer relationships.

Pant University of Agriculture & Technology, Uttarakhand, Pantnagar, India","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has vast potential in marketing. It aids in proliferating information and data sources, improving software's data management capabilities, and designing intricate and advanced algorithms. AI is changing the way brands and users interact with one another. The application of this technology is highly dependent on the nature of the website and the type of business. Marketers can now focus more on the customer and meet their needs in real time. By using AI, they can quickly determine what content to target customers and which channel to employ at what moment, thanks to the data collected and generated by its algorithms. Users feel at ease and are more inclined to buy what is offered when AI is used to personalise their experiences. AI tools can also be used to analyse the performance of a competitor's campaigns and reveal their customers' expectations. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows computers to analyse and interpret data without being explicitly programmed. Furthermore, ML assists humans in solving problems efficiently. The algorithm learns and improves performance and accuracy as more data is fed into the algorithm. For this research, relevant articles on AI in marketing are identified from Scopus, Google scholar, researchGate and other platforms. Then these articles were read, and the theme of the paper was developed. This paper attempts to review the role of AI in marketing. The specific applications of AI in various marketing segments and their transformations for marketing sectors are examined. Finally, critical applications of AI for marketing are recognised and analysed. © 2022 The Author(s)",Applications; Artificial intelligence (AI); Customer; Data analysis; Decision; Marketing,Commerce; Information management; Learning algorithms; Sales; Artificial intelligence; Customer; Data-source; Decision; Information sources; Machine-learning; Management capabilities; Marketing IS; Real- time; Software data; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,"Verma S., Sharma R., Deb S., Maitra D., Artificial intelligence in marketing: systematic review and future research direction, Int.

Internet and social media have become an indispensable part of people’s daily lives worldwide. However, most previous research only focuses on social media marketing in other businesses, and there is less research about the development of boutique hotel social media marketing. This study investigates the relationship between different social media marketing practices and customers’ purchase intention in Malaysia’s boutique hotels. The article also explores how to properly conduct social media marketing to increase the customer purchase intention of boutique hotels and promote the boutique hotels’ development in Malaysia. The non-probability random sampling technique 309 response was collected from Malaysian social media users using an online survey. Findings of the research found out that factors including marketing activities and eWOM significantly impact customer purchase intention of the boutique hotels in Malaysia through the mediating variable perceived usefulness and the mediating variable perceived trust. The study offers implications for the development of social media marketing in boutique hotels. © 2021 Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.

We can gain an understanding of customer behaviour, customer demand, and very valuable insights from the customer and transaction data that will help the business organisation achieve its goals and grow the business. In other words, these customer data can make a difference in marketing and product development strategies to improve customer satisfaction and business growth by making informed business decisions. The data can be collected through software, customer relationship management (CRM), point of sale data, HR, and ERP systems, user-generated systems, granular sales, online forms, and artificial Intelligence-powered systems. Consumer analytics is now no longer the job of technological companies. Any business can use consumer data for analytics and uncover the intelligence behind data. This chapter provides you with an abridgment of the fundamental subjects of consumer analytics. It particularly examines descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics as well as applications of them for present practices, in some business ventures like Amazon and Google. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the theory of consumer analytics, and virtually, it does not intend to offer any practical guidance in performing consumer analytics practically in businesses. © 2023 Mansaf Alam and Kiran Chaudhary.",nan,,,,,,,,"Aktas E., Meng Y., An exploration of big data practices in retail sector, Logistics, 1, 2, (2017);

Using detailed log-files of an online flight search engine, we analyze consumer search behavior and model the stages consumers go through along the funnel in both mobile and desktop platforms. We ask: Do mobile and desktop users go through similar funnel stages? Are the funnel stages of both platforms characterized differently? To analyze the progress through the funnel, we use hidden Markov models (HMM) that capture latent funnel stages based on observable search-behavior variables indicative of convergence towards a purchase. We find that while similar stochastic processes characterize funnel stages on both platforms, the distribution of visits across stages in the two platforms is significantly different: a larger percentage of mobile visits resides in more advanced stages, indicating that mobile consumers use the website when they are more advanced in the funnel, where less cognitive effort is required. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Conversion funnel; Hidden Markov models; HMM; M-commerce; Mobile; Purchasing funnel,Consumer behavior; Mobile commerce; Mobile telecommunication systems; Search engines; Stochastic systems; Cognitive efforts; Conversion funnel; Hidden-Markov models; Logfile; M-commerce; Mobile; Purchasing funnel; Search behavior; Search models; Hidden Markov models,,,,,,,"Abhishek V., Fader P., Hosanagar K., The long road to online conversion: a model of multi-channel attribution, SSRN J., (2012); Adipat Z., Zhou, The effects of tree-view based presentation adaptation on mobile web browsing, MISQ, 35, (2011); (2018); Agarwal R., Venkatesh V., Assessing a Firm's Web Presence: A Heuristic Evaluation Procedure for the Measurement of Usability, Inform Syst Res, 13, pp. 168-186, (2002); Barry T.E., The development of the hierarchy of effects: an historical perspective, Curr.

However, a very limited number of such technologies are able to make the transition from the lab to the competitive B2B marketplace. The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors influencing SEAD adoption in the manufacturing industry using the Industrial Buyer Innovation Adoption (IBIA) model, which integrates B2B consumer behavior theories and technology acceptance models from the past 50 years. Analysis of data collected from 400 corporations in Thailand revealed that sellers, buyers, internal organization and invented technology advantage variables predicted industrial innovation adoption based on binary logistic regression. This research contributes to the understanding of SEAD transition from scientific knowledge to sustainable technology and diffusible innovation. The ambitious IBIA framework is potentially an alternative managerial tool for holistically assessing and creating adoptable innovative business models for new technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

Accordingly, the transfer of shopping activities from traditional markets to e-commerce has accelerated. Urban retail has substantially declined by competing with these disrupting factors, but resilience capabilities are known to vary by scale and regional characteristics. This study identifies which types of retail clusters were more resilient to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. This research focuses on the changes in online and in-store sales and how retailers recovered differently at the neighborhood and district levels in 2019 and 2020. This research compares the resilience of two types of retail clusters by calculating the loss of resilience and online adaptivity. The findings suggest that neighborhood-level retail areas were more resilient and bounced back in sales at a faster rate than district-level retail areas during the pandemic. These findings suggest that retail clusters are more resilient if they have steady populations and low-rent loads and can accommodate online shopping. The study contributes theoretical insights into how sales have changed and how e-commerce has increased the resilience of retail clusters throughout the pandemic by examining in-store and online sales. © 2023",COVID-19; Credit card sales data; In-store and online sales; Retail clusters; Retail resilience,cluster analysis; COVID-19; disease spread; electronic commerce; neighborhood; retailing,,,,,"Fostering Outstanding Universities for Research; Ministry of Education, MOE, (NRF-2019S1A5A2A01047678); Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT, (KAIA001434041G0003186); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement, KAIA","This work was supported by the BK21 FOUR (Fostering Outstanding Universities for Research) funded by the Ministry of Education (MOE, Korea) and National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF).

Due to the challenges faced by Small-and-medium-enterprises (SMEs), they are suggested to embrace social media technology. Previous studies in Interactive value creation theory (IVF) indicated that SMEs-followers co-creation processes enable Instagram engagement. However, little is known of how to promote the value co-creation process via practical Instagram micro-practices that SMEs can employ regarding their constraints. This study is among the first to examine SMEs' practices for Instagram engagement via the process of value co-creation. Method: We collected data regarding Instagram engagements of 10 Australian SMEs in eight months period using Instagram API. Qualitative analysis is conducted based on 2110 contents in a Poisson regression model. Content analysis and time-series visualizations are employed to investigate the uniqueness of several outliners in the dataset. Results: Findings imply that SMEs should bank on @Tagging instead of #Hashtags to get more engagement as contents with@Tagging show higher levels of inclusiveness and trustworthiness. Also, customized postings for the loci-specific audience effectively encourage followers to participate in conversations, while commercial intensive posting style shows adverse effects due to its low level of credibility. Rich media contents would not necessarily reel in more engagement; the commitment and consistent postings amassed a considerable number of followers over time, leading to a higher engagement rate. Conclusions: This study confirmed the benefits of data scraping in building business intelligence and validate the IVF framework as the theoretical background to investigate the effectiveness of Instagram micro-practices. IVF should be considered in designing social media practices to enable SMEs and followers' collaborations for business value generation. This study provides extra interpretations of the interrelationships between IVF, visual-rich contents, and social media engagement. © Association for Information Systems.",Australian SMEs; Engagement; Instagram; Web Scraping,,,,,,,,"Agung N.

With the advance of Internet and e-commerce, consumers prefer to purchase online. Online platform information has become an essential source for exploring consumer attention. However, there is often a mismatch between the information provided by retailers and the feedback received from consumers, leading to an imbalance between the supply side and demand side of online information. The purpose of this study is therefore to provide a unified approach to discover consumer attention from the design topic aspect by revealing the information imbalance between supply side and demand side. Design/methodology/approach: To address the issue of online information imbalance and discover consumer attention, this study proposed an approach that focuses on the design topic perspective. The design topic is a collection of design elements that represent a clothing-design feature more comprehensively and accurately compared to a single design element. The proposed approach begins with generating design topics through topic modeling based on online information provided by retailers on e-commerce platforms. Two indicators, influence degree and attention degree, are then used to quantify the intensity of supply information and consumer attention related to design topics. Finally, design topic strategy diagrams are constructed to reveal information imbalance and discover consumer attention. Findings: The experimental case demonstrates the existence of information imbalance, indicating that the intensity of supply information and consumer attention from the perspective of design topics is not uniform, although both follow the Pareto principle. The results of consumer attention distribution with heavy power-law tails are consistent with current research findings. This further demonstrates that the proposed approach is capable of discovering consumer attention in the design topic strategy diagrams. Practical implications: The issue of information imbalance between retailers and consumers poses a challenge in keeping up with customer attention. The proposed approach offers a practical solution by visually identifying the symptoms of information imbalance and discovering consumer attention through design topic strategy diagrams. This approach provides fast-fashion retailers with a valuable reference to seize market opportunities, improve product design and adjust marketing or management strategies. Originality/value: This study proposes a novel approach to disclose the issue of information imbalance between supply side and demand side and therefore to discover consumer attention from the perspective of design topics. In addition, guidelines for applying the proposed approach for fast-fashion marketing and management are presented. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer attention; Fast fashion; Information imbalance; Strategic diagram; Topic model,,,,,,,,"Alley, Research on personalized clothing recommendation based on commodity attributes and user clustering, Modern Intelligence, 35, 9, pp. 165-170, (2015); Arbatskaya M., Aslam M.V., Liability or labeling?

However, the users of social media services may perceive that personalized content is intrusive. These two components may influence consumers’ purchase intention in social media personalization campaigns. Thus, this positivism empirical research proposes a theoretical framework named PI2 using the personalization-intrusiveness-intention, as well as a success measurement based upon privacy calculus theory for effective social media personalization campaigns. Further, we investigated digital mnemonics’ potential influences with emotion as social information theory and different degrees of product involvement together with the model. Based upon the analysis of a total of 800 social media users, the results indicated that personalization positively affected but intrusiveness negatively affected the purchase intention. Furthermore, personalization significantly affected purchase intention through intrusiveness and the interaction of personalization with digital mnemonics negatively influenced consumers’ purchase intention on high involvement ads. In the post-hoc analysis, the moderating effect of users’ demographic variables was found to have some influence on the PI2 framework. The findings of this research provide theoretical and managerial implications for researchers and field practitioners in social media personalization. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Digital mnemonic; Emotion as social information; Intrusiveness; Privacy calculus theory; Social media personalization,Calculations; Economic and social effects; Information theory; Sales; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Calculus theories; Digital mnemonic; Emotion as social information; Intrusiveness; Personalizations; Privacy calculus theory; Purchase intention; Social information; Social media; Social medium personalization; Purchasing,,,,,"Sungkyunkwan University, SKKU","This paper was supported by SKKU Excellence in Research Award Research Fund , Sungkyunkwan University, 2021.

This study investigates the evolution and trends of the research and channel shopping behaviors (RCSB) domain, spanning from 1998 to 2022, including the Covid-19 era. The study performed a bibliometric review of 500 papers in the Scopus database. The performance analysis reveals an annual growth rate of nearly 16%, with average citations per document of 44, indicating sustained and growing research interest. Science mapping revealed five distinct cluster themes, including showrooming and webrooming in multi- and omni-channel contexts; consumer behavior in online retail and shopping; customer satisfaction and trust in multi-channel retailing; mobile commerce in a multi-channel environment; and the interplay between online shopping, channel choice, and supply chain management. Furthermore, topics, such as showrooming, e-commerce, retailing, and omnichannel retailing, remain popular before and during the pandemic, as seen in the thematic evolution. Our examination of the thematic maps revealed various topics that gained significance during the pandemic, such as multichannel, channel choice, customer experience, social commerce, purchase behavior, and covid-19. Among these, the thematic maps indicate that customer experience, channel choice, multichannel, and covid-19 are emerging and basic topics. These topics can steer research directions in the RCSB domain toward examining customer experiences using digital innovations, e-commerce (including mobile and social commerce), and omnichannel strategy and management. © 2023 The Authors.

We used sales data and plug it into MATLAB to implement ant clustering algorithm and K-means, then the results were analyzed using RFM-location model to calculate each clusters' customer lifetime value (CLV). The algorithm generated 13 clusters of retailers based on provided data with a total of 1,138 retailers. Then, using RFM-location, some clusters were combined due to identical characteristics, the final clusters amounted to 8 clusters with unique characteristics. The findings can inform the decision-making process of the company, especially in prioritizing retailer segments and developing a tailored marketing strategy. We used a hybrid algorithm by leveraging the advantage of swarm intelligence and the power of K-means to cluster the retailers, then we further added value to the generated clusters by analyzing it using RFM-location model and CLV. However, location as a variable may not be relevant in smaller countries or developed countries, because the shipping cost may not be a problem. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

In this context, this study aims to discover and summarize the key optimisations regarding the creative ad components needed to run highly personalized ads based on a user profile. The participants were Facebook users between the ages of 18 and 65+ who were interested in dental services. Qualitative methods were adopted in order to discover suitable options for professionals to grow their business. In the first stage, the A/B split test using the Facebook Ads manager labelled the most effective creative component. In the second stage, an eye-tracking experiment generated 30 heatmaps that showed the differences between the segments. The results show solutions for attracting users by increasing the level of personalization of the ads. They are more beneficial for social media campaigns aimed at brand awareness targeting women and showing them a happy human face. When the target audience is men, technical details are preferred in order for the ad to become more attractive for them. This study enriches the literature and empowers professionals to deploy social media marketing growth strategies to attract users and make them convert to their full potential. © 2021 by the authors.",A/B split test; Business growth; Creative optimisation; Digital marketing for the dental industry; Eye tracking; Personalization; Social media marketing; User profile,,,,,,Transylvania University of Bras; Transylvania University of Brașov,"Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by the Transylvania University of Bras,ov.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Transylvania University of Brașov.","Chang Y.W., Hsu P.Y., Wang Y., Chang P.Y., Integration of online and offline health services: The role of doctor-patient online interaction, Patient Educ.

However, algorithms often fail to perform as expected due to various data, model, and market biases. Motivated by this challenge, this study presents a framework of algorithmic bias management capabilities for industrial markets that contribute to customer equity in terms of value, brand and relationship equity. Drawing on the dynamic capability theory, this study fills this gap by conducting a literature review, thematic analysis, and two rounds of surveys (n=200 analytics professionals and n=200 business customers) in the financial service industry in Australia. The findings show that algorithmic bias management capability consists of three primary dimensions (data, model, and deployment capabilities) and nine subdimensions. These findings have important implications for scholars and managers interested in developing algorithmic bias management capabilities to influence customer equity in industrial markets. © 2023 The Authors",AI-driven marketing analytics; Algorithmic bias; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,"Federal Government ends Robodebt class action with settlement worth $1.2 billion, (2020); Adam M., Wessel M., Benlian A., AI-based chatbots in customer service and their effects on user compliance, Electronic Markets, 31, 2, pp. 427-445, (2021); Adomavicius G., Bockstedt J., Curley S.P., Zhang J., Ransbotham S., The hidden side effects of recommendation systems, MIT Sloan Management Review, 60, 2, (2019); Akter S., D'Ambra J., Ray P., Trustworthiness in mHealth information services: An assessment of a hierarchical model with mediating and moderating effects using partial least squares (PLS), Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62, 1, pp. 100-116, (2011); Akter S., Dwivedi Y.K., Biswas K., Michael K., Bandara R.J., Sajib S., Addressing algorithmic bias in AI-driven customer management, Journal of Global Information Management (JGIM), 29, 6, pp. 1-27, (2021); Akter S., Dwivedi Y.K., Sajib S., Biswas K., Bandara R.J., Michael K., Algorithmic bias in machine learning-based marketing models, Journal of Business Research, 144, pp. 201-216, (2022); Akter S., Fosso Wamba S., Dewan S., Why PLS-SEM is suitable for complex modelling?

The goal of this paper is to form an architecture of an MDSS, the model base of which is developed on Data Science tools, in particular regression analysis and machine learning methods. The proposed MDSS is a multi-agent information system comprising nine intellectual agents (market environment monitoring, data processing, marketing mix modeling, price policy support, portfolio management, strategic analysis, forecasting, customer segmentation, and customer classification). The functionality of these agents is realized through Data Science, which allows for the optimization of marketing activities (e.g., an effective brand management strategy and its elements (portfolio strategy, price policy, and media strategy) or solving the problems of attracting new and retaining current customers with the maximal return on marketing investments). The MDSS analyzes the marketing environment, media activity, and business indicators by constructing different models and forecasting various combinations of marketing factors to select the best one. The joint work of MDSS agents provides decision-makers with interactive reports. The research findings offer a scientific basis for making effective marketing decisions based on data, and the proposed MDSS can become part of an intelligent system for planning marketing activities. © Galyna Chornous, Yana Fareniuk, Vincentas Rolandas Giedraitis, Erstida Ulvidienė, Ganna Kharlamova, 2023.",decision-making; enterprise; intelligent agent; marketing mix; marketing strategy; modeling; multi-agent system,,,,,,,,"Ai W.-G., Sun J., Li H., A distributed marketing decision support system based on multiintelligent-agent, Proceedings of 2004 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, pp. 233-238, (2004); Alexouda G., A user-friendly marketing decision support system for the product line design using evolutionary algorithms, Decision Support Systems, 38, 4, pp. 495-509, (2005); Birn R., Stone M., Key issues in managing marketing research and customer insight, The Routledge companion to marketing research, pp. 219-243, (2021); Bulling N.

Researchers are faced with a variety of research strategies depending on the nature of the research problem and data. If the right research strategy is not employed, the researcher will lose focus, and the time and effort spent will not necessarily serve the research objectives. When choosing a research strategy, the organization's characteristics should be taken into consideration; otherwise, it may lead to confounding interpretations of the findings. In this regard, the present study aims to introduce an appropriate research strategy for each maturity stage of the organization under study. To this end, using systematic mapping methodology, about 256 articles published within 2011- 2021 were investigated, and the relationship between the types of research strategy used and the different stages of an organization's maturity in using social media was reported. Specifically, by synthesizing the social sciences research methodology framework and the social media stage of the growth model, a mapping was developed between the research strategies and maturity stages. Based on this mapping, it is expected that the appropriate strategy for research at the first maturity stage is exploratory, and for the second and third stages are observational and descriptive, respectively. When the organization moves to the fourth and fifth levels, archival and causal strategies are recommended for research. Using the results of this research, researchers will be able to identify the right research strategy for the maturity stage of the organization under study and develop the appropriate research design accordingly. © 2021 University of Tehran.

Nonetheless, research evaluating the types and characteristics of systematic literature review (SLR) journal articles produced in the digital marketing literature is limited. This study examines how digital marketing academicians have empirically validated reviews by using the reporting process for systematic items for meta-data analyses and systematic reviews. It also concentrates on reviewing literature in digital marketing subjects that were published in the Scopus database originally appeared from 2011 to 2021 and offers new perspectives and areas for further research. Data for the study was gathered from Scopus databases also chooses appropriately 923 articles and performs metadata evaluation. The study delineates research on important digital marketing papers with the main identification and overview of that papers. This study identifies influential authors, top journals, top contributing countries, top contributing institutions, and contributions by disciplines. This study presents a comprehensive but straightforward conceptual model of digital marketing. The study’s findings and suggestions for future research open up a new path of inquiry and contribution to this field. © 2022 The Authors.",Digital Marketing; Prisma; Systematic Review,,,,,,,,"A blueprint for international marketing, Strategic Direction, 36, 4, pp. 30-32, (2020); Afroze R., Shafi S., Adoption of digital marketing in e-recruitment success: A quantitative study on Bangladesh perspective, Journal of Management Research, 13, 4, pp. 20-54, (2021); Agus A.

Marketing is the process of finding the potential customers and sales is the process of converting those potential customers into real customers. Hence, it is imperative that marketing and sales go hand in hand. Developing marketing strategies needs proper market research which can cover the relevant pointers like demographics, culture, spending power, income and many more. The process of segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP) is carried out to develop marketing and sales strategies. STP is done by collection of the marketing intelligence. For this process, surveys are also used but data mining has far more effective and better results so far. Organizations tend to take risk because of the importance and relevance of the marketing and sales department. Most of the budget in the organizations is allocated for marketing and promotional activities. For making data-driven and accurate decisions, data mining is used in various fields to extract valuable information and patterns. This paper discusses the use of the data mining concept on marketing. This paper aims to analyze marketing data with k-means data mining clustering techniques and to find the relationship between marketing and k-means data mining clustering techniques. © 2022 Russian Association of Forensic Medical Experts.

However, whether such a practice is effective remains unclear. Respondents may either impulsively purchase the recommended health products or simply distance themselves psychologically from the information. Building on protection motivation theory (PMT), this study uncovers the mechanisms behind these two coping responses to persuasive messages, namely, the impulsive purchasing and psychological distancing of OHC users. Correspondingly, we evaluated 366 valid questionnaires, and the results reveal that (1) when encountering fear appeals, perceived health threat can evoke cyberchondria, leading to psychological distancing; and (2) when encountering coping appeals, perceived response efficacy leads to product affection, fostering impulsive purchasing. This study provides new insights into the effects of persuasive messages for health product promotion in social commerce. Marketers should design appropriate persuasive messages to foster impulsive purchasing by generating individuals’ product affection and avoiding cyberchondria. © 2023",Coping strategy; Health product promotion; Online health communities; Persuasive message; Protection motivation theory,coping strategy; health care; marketing,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72001005, 72025101, 72101104)","We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 72001005 , 72025101 , and 72101104 ) for providing funding for part of this research.

This new era allows the consumer to directly connect with other individuals, business corporations, and the government. People are open to sharing opinions, views, and ideas on any topic in different formats out loud. This creates the opportunity to make the 'Big Social Data' handy by implementing machine learning approaches and social data analytics. This study offers an overview of recent works in social media, data science, and machine learning to gain a wide perspective on social media big data analytics. We explain why social media data are significant elements of the improved data-driven decision-making process. We propose and build the 'Sunflower Model of Big Data' to define big data and bring it up to date with technology by combining 5 V's and 10 Bigs. We discover the top ten social data analytics to work in the domain of social media platforms. A comprehensive list of relevant statistical/machine learning methods to implement each of these big data analytics is discussed in this work. 'Text Analytics' is the most used analytics in social data analysis to date. We create a taxonomy on social media analytics to meet the need and provide a clear understanding. Tools, techniques, and supporting data type are also discussed in this research work. As a result, researchers will have an easier time deciding which social data analytics would best suit their needs.  © 2018 Tsinghua University Press.",audio analytics; big data; big data analytics; descriptive analytics; diagnostic analytics; image analytics; predictive analytics; prescriptive analytics; social media; social media analytics; text analytics; video analytics,Behavioral research; Big data; Data Analytics; Decision making; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Audio analytic; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Descriptive analytic; Diagnostic analytic; Image analytic; Prescriptive analytic; Social media; Social media analytics; Text analytics; Video analytics; Predictive analytics,,,,,,,"Dhawan V., Zanini N., Big data and social media analytics, Res.

However, prior studies were limited to a single platform and showed the effects of UGC of a platform, for example, customer textual comments or customer numeral ratings, on sales/reservation of the same platform. In practice, users often refer to a UGC, for example, Instagram, and purchase it on other platforms. To incorporate the spillover effect, we considered the restaurant industry because it has active participation across various channels. Using topic modelling, we first identified from Instagram four topics of users’ interest regarding a restaurant, such as location, nightlife, food and celebration. From fixed effects models’ estimation, we found that (a) recommendation and mention of Instagram have positive effects, and (b) comments of location and food also have positive significant fixed effects, but (c) the impact of Instagram volume is curvilinear and positive significant effect the sales. Since the curvilinear effects may come from reverse causality, that is, higher reservation, might bring more customers and comments on social networking service (SNS) (echo verse effect in our paper). Therefore, we further analysed two-way Granger causality and panel vector autoregression to identify the endogeneity, and the results showed the existing Granger causality loop between OpenTable review and Instagram post volumes. © 2021 International Management Institute, New Delhi.",Datafication; echo verse; fixed effect; panel vector autoregression; text mining,,,,,,,,"Agarwal S., Deep learning-based sentiment analysis: Establishing customer dimension as the lifeblood of business management, Global Business Review, (2019); Akhtar P., Frynas J.G., Mellahi K., Ullah S., Big data-savvy teams’ skills, big data-driven actions and business performance, British Journal of Management, 30, 2, pp. 252-271, (2019); Akhtar P., Khan Z., Tarba S., Jayawickrama U., The internet of things, dynamic data and information processing capabilities, and operational agility, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 136, pp. 307-316, (2018); Allison P.D., Christakis N.A., Fixed-effects methods for the analysis of nonrepeated events, Sociological Methodology, 36, 1, pp. 155-172, (2006); Alrawadieh Z., Law R., Determinants of hotel guests’ satisfaction from the perspective of online hotel reviewers, International Journal of Culture, Tourism and Hospitality Research, (2019); Alrawadieh Z., Zeki D.M., Reputation management in cyberspace: Evidence from Jordan’s luxury hotel market, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology, 10, 1, pp. 107-120, (2019); Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 54, 1, pp. 84-94; Anderl E., Schumann J.H., Kunz W., Helping firms reduce complexity in multichannel online data: A new taxonomy-based approach for customer journeys, Journal of Retailing, 92, 2, pp. 185-203, (2016); Andrews D.W.K., Lu B., Consistent model and moment selection procedures for GMM estimation with application to dynamic panel data models, Journal of Econometrics, 101, 1, pp. 123-164, (2001); Arguello J., Butler B.S., Joyce E., Kraut R., Ling K.S., Rose C., Wang X., Talk to me: Foundations for successful individual-group interactions in online communities, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2006); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative strategies in social media marketing: An exploratory study of branded social content and consumer engagement, Psychology and Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Atkin C., Block M., Effectiveness of celebrity endorsers, Journal of Advertising Research, 23, 1, pp. 57-61, (1983); Atsiz O., Cifci I., Law R., Understanding food experience in sharing-economy platforms: Insights from eatwith and withlocals, Journal of Tourism and Cultural Change, pp. 1-26, (2021); Aydin G., Social media engagement and organic post effectiveness: A roadmap for increasing the effectiveness of social media use in hospitality industry, Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management, 29, 1, pp. 1-21, (2020); Ba S., Pavlou P.A., Evidence of the effect of trust building technology in electronic markets: Price premiums and buyer behavior, The Mississippi Quarterly, 26, 3, pp. 243-268, (2002); Balducci B., Marinova D., Unstructured data in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 46, 4, pp. 557-590, (2018); Baltagi B.H., Song S.H., Unbalanced panel data: A survey, Statistical Papers, 47, 4, pp. 493-523, (2006); Baltagi B.H., Song S.H., Jung B.C., The unbalanced nested error component regression model, Journal of Econometrics, 101, 2, pp. 357-381, (2001); Berger C.R., Roloff M.E., Wilson S.R., Dillard J.P., Caughlin J., Solomon D., the international encyclopedia of interpersonal communication, 1, pp. 1-21, (2015); Bergkvist L., Zhou K.Q., Celebrity endorsements: A literature review and research agenda, International Journal of Advertising, 35, 4, pp. 642-663, (2016); Bi J.W., Liu Y., Fan Z.P., Zhang J., Wisdom of crowds: Conducting importance-performance analysis (IPA) through online reviews, Tourism Management, 70, pp. 460-478, (2019); Bi J.-W., Liu Y., Fan Z.-P., Zhang J., Wisdom of crowds: Conducting importance-performance analysis (IPA) through online reviews, Tourism Management, 70, pp. 460-478, (2019); Bibri S.E., The compact city paradigm and its centrality in sustainable urbanism in the era of big data revolution: A comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review, Advances in the leading paradigms of urbanism and their amalgamation: Compact cities, eco–cities, and data–driven smart cities, pp. 9-39, (2020); Bigne E., Simonetti A., Ruiz C., Kakaria S., How online advertising competes with user-generated content in TripAdvisor.

The profound economic crisis that followed the rise of the pandemic has pushed firms and researchers to question the necessary changes and new challenges for the survival of businesses. In this scenario, the aim of the paper is to analyze and classify the main contributions published on the topic of COVID-19 in managerial literature, seeking to discover the perspective and the gaps and outline future avenues of research. A systematic review of the literature has been performed. The results highlight the orientation of studies in this field and the various links between different aspects that emerged.

However, despite these advances, relevant evidence on the measures to improve the management of Data Sciences in digital marketing remains scarce. To bridge this gap in the literature, the present study aims to review (i) methods of analysis, (ii) uses, and (iii) performance metrics based on Data Sciences as used in digital marketing techniques and strategies. To this end, a comprehensive literature review of major scientific contributions made so far in this research area is undertaken. The results present a holistic overview of the main applications of Data Sciences to digital marketing and generate insights related to the creation of innovative Data Mining and knowledge discovery techniques. Important theoretical implications are discussed, and a list of topics is offered for further research in this field. The review concludes with formulating recommendations on the development of digital marketing strategies for businesses, marketers, and non-technical researchers and with an outline of directions of further research on innovative Data Mining and knowledge discovery applications. © 2020 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge",Data Mining;

Both the expected returns and the social network structure are analyzed, and both have positive effects on knowledge sharing in the actual development process, but the degree of them also possesses certain variability. A model of the factors influencing the quality of knowledge shared by users is constructed to explore the relationship between the dimensions in social capital and how they affect the community users' perceptions of knowledge quality. Exploring the strong influencing factors of product repurchase rate has key implications for promoting product sales and sales forecasting. The scale of this paper has undergone several minor revisions, and the content validity is very good. Criterion validity is generally reflected by Person correlation coefficient, and construct validity includes exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. First, the values were clustered, and the optimal variables were selected using stepwise regression and fitted with Poisson regression models to explore the relationship between the repurchase rate of different products and the factors that strongly influence the repurchase rate in the case. To predict the sales of goods, the advantages of the BP neural network, LSTM neural network, and Verhulst gray model are combined: BP neural network can predict sales by combining the current data corresponding to independent variables, LSTM neural network can explore the influence of historical data on sales, and Verhulst model can predict sales based on the growth trend of variables. A BP-LSTM-Verhulst nested neural network based on the AP algorithm is constructed to predict sales volume, and the accuracy of this method is proved by example. Finally, it is found that the proposed sales prediction method has higher accuracy than exponential regression and shallow neural networks. The deep learning prediction method combining unstructured data such as images proposed in the paper not only provides a more accurate sales prediction method for short life cycle products in e-commerce but also provides an effective deep learning method for management practices. The KMO value obtained after the test is less than 0.5, which is not suitable for factor analysis. Using SPSS22.0 to expand the KMO value and Bartlett's sphericity test, the KMO value is significantly greater than the minimum requirement of 0.5, the KMO value of self-efficacy is 0.826, and the KMO value of expected return is 0.870.  © 2022 Li Tian and Xiumei Wang.",nan,"Algorithms; Commerce; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Forecasting; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Big data; Consumer behavior; E-learning; Electronic commerce; Factor analysis; Forecasting; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Life cycle; Long short-term memory; Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Social networking (online); Virtual reality; BP neural networks; Cross-border; Dynamic prediction; E- commerces; Expected return; Factors analysis; Knowledge-sharing; Neural-networks; Prediction methods; Virtual community; algorithm; commercial phenomena; factor analysis; forecasting; human; Sales",,,,,,,"Wu C., Yan B., Yu R., Yu B., Zhou X., Yu Y., Chen N., Retracted article: Digital forensics system based on dynamic path prediction and the competitiveness of cross-border e-commerce SMEs, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 25, 1, (2021); Li G., Li N., Customs classification for cross-border e-commerce based on text-image adaptive convolutional neural network, Electronic Commerce Research, 19, 4, pp. 779-800, (2019); Xia H., Weng J., Zhang J.Z., Gao Y., Rural E-commerce model with attention mechanism: Role of Li ziqi's short videos from the perspective of heterogeneous knowledge management, Journal of Global Information Technology Management, 25, 2, pp. 118-136, (2022); Rosario A., Raimundo R., Consumer marketing strategy and E-commerce in the last decade: A literature review, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 16, 7, pp. 3003-3024, (2021); Guan S., Smart E-commerce logistics construction model based on big data analytics, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 40, 2, pp. 3015-3023, (2021); Mumu J.R., Saona P., Mamun M.A.A., Azad M.A.K., Is trust gender biased?

Consequently, there are two primary research goals in this work. The initial goal was to examine the impact of customer segmentation on the accuracy of customer churn prediction in the banking sector using machine learning models. The second objective is to experiment, contrast, and assess which machine learning approaches are most effective in predicting customer churn. Background This paper reviews the theoretical basis of customer churn, and customer segmentation, and suggests using supervised machine-learning techniques for customer attrition prediction. Methodology In this study, we use different machine learning models such as k-means clustering to segment customers, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine to apply to the dataset to predict customer churn. Contribution The results demonstrate that the dataset performs well with the random forest model, with an accuracy of about 97%, and that, following customer segmentation, the mean accuracy of each model performed well, with logistic regression having the lowest accuracy (87.27%) and random forest having the best (97.25%). Findings Customer segmentation does not have much impact on the precision of predictions. It is dependent on the dataset and the models we choose. Recommendations for Practitioners The practitioners can apply the proposed solutions to build a predictive system or apply them in other fields such as education, tourism, marketing, and human resources. Recommendations for Researchers The research paradigm is also applicable in other areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and churn prediction. Impact on Society Customer churn will cause the value flowing from customers to enterprises to decrease. If customer churn continues to occur, the enterprise will gradually lose its competitive advantage. Future Research Build a real-time or near real-time application to provide close information to make good decisions. Furthermore, handle the imbalanced data using new techniques. © 2023 Informing Science Institute.

The paper also aims to define the most broad and influential segments of Facebook users and their collective traits in terms of shopping behaviour, fashion brand preference, price preference, liking for quality, demand of new fashion, consumer social behaviour, etc. An online survey was conducted in which 158 users participated through structured questionnaire. The results give a clear idea about the consumer segments, which lie, on social media such as Facebook. Practitioners may define their targeting and positioning strategy based on the newly formed consumer segments. Practitioners and researchers may directly create and use consumer segments through social media behaviour of the consumers.

The volume explores the present and future challenges faced by the tourism industry as a result of the generational turnover, and seeks to answer the following questions: What contribution can the new generations make to the future of tourism? How are technological advancements and social networks shaping future travel trends? Can a generational perspective be useful to help the tourism industry recover from the COVID-19 crisis? The book will be of interest to researchers and students of sociology and tourism studies, as well as tourism professionals. © 2022 Fabio Corbisiero, Salvatore Monaco and Elisabetta Ruspini.",nan,,,,,,,,"Aboim S., Vasconcelos P., From political to social generations: A critical reappraisal of Mannheim’s classical approach, European Journal of Social Theory, 17, 2, pp. 165-183, (2013); Abulibdeh A., Can Covid-19 mitigation measures promote telework practices?, Journal of Labor and Society, 23, 4, pp. 551-576, (2020); Global Consumer Survey 2018, (2018); Adamy J., Millennials slammed by second financial crisis fall even further behind, The Wall Street Journal, (2020); Akhavan Sarraf A.R., Generational groups in different countries, International Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, 4, 1, pp. 41-52, (2019); Akiyama I., Basic and recent applied technologies of ultrasound in the field of clinical diagnosis, J-Stage, 41, 6, pp. 845-850, (2020); Aldrich R., The Seduction of Mediterranean: Writing, Art and Homosexual Fantasy, (1993); Aldrich R., Homosexuality and the city: An historical overview, Urban Studies, 41, pp. 1719-1737, (2004); Algar R., Collaborative consumption, Leisure Report, 4, pp. 16-17, (2007); Allen R.S., Allen D.E., Karl K., White C.S., Are millennials really an entitled generation?

Data were included from a health insurance company for providing insight into churn behaviour based on a design and application of a prediction model. Additionally, three promising data mining techniques were identified for the prediction of modeling, including logistic regression, neural network, and K-means. The decision tree method was used in the modeling phase of CRISP-DM for identifying the attributes of churned customers. The predictive analysis task is undertaken through classification and regression techniques. K-means clustering variation is selected for exploring if the clustering algorithms categorize the customers in churning and non-churning groups with homogeneous profiles. The findings of the study show that data mining procedures can be very successful in extracting hidden information and get to know customer's information. The 50:50 training set distribution resulted in effective outcomes when the logistic regression technique was used throughout this study. A 70:30 distribution worked effectively for the neural network technique. In this regard, it is concluded that each technique works effectively with a different training set distribution. The predicted findings can have direct implications for the marketing department of the selected insurance company, whereas the models are anticipated to be readily applicable in other environments via this data mining approach. This study has shown that the prediction models can be utilized throughout a health insurance company's marketing strategy and in a general academic context with a combination of a research-based emphasis with a business problem-solving approach. © 2021, The Author(s).",Customer Churn; Data mining techniques; Extraction knowledge; Marketing department,,,,,,,,"Amin A., Anwar S., Adnan A., Nawaz M., Alawfi K., Hussain A., Huang K., Customer churn prediction in the telecommunication sector using a rough set approach, Neurocomputing, 237, pp. 242-254, (2017); Amjad H., Reham D., Osama H., Ruba O., Hossam F., Hybrid data mining models for predicting customer churn, Int J Commun Netw Syst Sci, 8, pp. 91-96, (2015); Arowolo M.O., Abdulsalam S.O., Isiaka R.M., Gbolagade K.A., A hybrid dimensionality reduction model for classification of microarray dataset, Int J Inf Technol Comput Sci, 9, 11, pp. 57-63, (2017); Arowolo M.O., Adebiyi M.O., Adebiyi A.A., Okesola O.J., A hybrid heuristic dimensionality reduction method for classifying malaria vector gene expression data, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 182422-182430, (2020); Arowolo M.O., Adebiyi M., Adebiyi A.A., Okesola J.O., PCA model for RNA-Seq malaria vector data classification using KNN and decision tree algorithm, Int Conf Math Comput Eng Comput Sci, (2020); Arowolo M.O., Isiaka R.M., Abdulsalam S.O., Saheed Y.K., Gbolagade K.A., A comparative analysis of feature extraction methods for classifying colon cancer microarray data, EAI Endorsed Trans Scalable Inf Syst, (2017); Dolatabadi S.H., Keynia F., Designing of customer and employee churn prediction model based on data mining method and neural predictor, 2Nd International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS)., pp. 74-77, (2017); Fathian M., Hoseinpoor Y., Minaei-Bidgoli B., Offering a hybrid approach of data mining to predict the customer churn based on bagging and boosting methods, Kybernetes, 45, 5, pp. 732-743, (2016); Figalist I., Elsner C., Bosch J., Olsson H.H., Customer Churn Prediction in B2B Contexts, International Conference on Software Business, pp. 378-386, (2019); Franciska I., Swaminathan B., Churn prediction analysis using various clustering algorithms in KNIME analytics platform, 2017 Third International Conference on Sensing, Signal Processing and Security, pp. 166-170, (2017); He Y., Xiong Y., Tsai Y., Machine learning based approaches to predict customer churn for an insurance company, 2020 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS, pp. 1-6, (2020); Keramati A., Ghaneei H., Mirmohammadi S.M., Developing a prediction model for customer churn from electronic banking services using data mining, Financial Innov, 2, pp. 2-13, (2016); Liu R.Q., Lee Y.C., Mu H.L., Customer classification and market basket analysis using K-means clustering and association rules: evidence from distribution big data of korean retailing company, Knowl Manag Res, 19, pp. 59-76, (2018); Martinez-Plumed F., Contreras-Ochando L., Ferri C., Et al., CRISP-DM twenty years later: from data mining processes to data science trajectories, IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng, (2019); Nadali A., Kakhky E.N., Nosratabadi H.E., Evaluating the success level of data mining projects based on CRISP-DM methodology by a Fuzzy expert system.

Typically, a promotional post by an influencer aims to direct the viewers to buy a product from a brand’s website. The objective of this paper is to analyse the factors that contribute to the popularity of promotional posts in terms of likes and website visits count. This research utilised Facebook (FB), Instagram (IG) and Google Analytics (GA) data collected from the ambassadors (or influencers) of MeCan App, a Malaysian e-commerce company. The factors that contribute to popularity have been successfully identified, such as the optimal posting time, hashtags, image type, interval and ratio of posts. For example, they should post based on the ratio of one regular post for 5.4 promotional posts for the best exposure. Additionally, regression methods were implemented to predict website visit count, with an accuracy of 69.9 per cent using Random Forest Regressor. © Henry Stewart Publications 2054-7544 (2022–23).",e-commerce; machine learning; marketing; social media; strategy data analytics,,,,,,,,"Most Popular Social Networks Worldwide as of July 2021, Ranked by Number of Active Users, (2021); Ali Taha V., Pencarelli T., Skerhakova V., Fedorko R., Kosikova M., The Use of Social Media and Its Impact on Shopping Behavior of Slovak and Italian Consumers during COVID-19 Pandemic, Sustainability, 13, 4, pp. 1-19, (2021); Matosas-L o pez L., The Management of Digital Marketing Strategies in Social Network Services: A Comparison between American and European Organizations, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 7, 1, (2021); Vyatkina O.

It examines the effect of cognitive and affective social presence on consumer engagement by evaluating consumption values and trust in streamers. In this survey study, the responses of 221 individuals residing in large cities of China were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results showed that cognitive social presence had a positive effect on consumer engagement by mediating the utilitarian value and trust in streamers. Furthermore, affective social presence had a positive effect on consumer engagement through the hedonic value and trust in streamers. Thus, our research provides a new perspective to approaching a multidimensional social presence and understanding consumer behavior in live commerce. Moreover, it contributes to the application and expansion of social presence theory in this field © 2022, The Korean Society of Clothing and Textiles.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was proposed and tested. Data were collected from 208 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the textile industry in Valencia, Spain using a survey instrument. Partial least squares (PLS) allowed for the analysis of the data collected. Findings: The theoretical model explains 46.1% of the variation in the organisational reputation variable. The findings indicate that ethical data privacy has a beneficial effect on an organisation's reputation and eco-innovation. The findings also demonstrate how eco-innovation drives the development of new knowledge and green skills that, in turn, communicate to stakeholders a company's ethical commitment. These results should encourage SMEs to invest in data privacy in order to meet the needs of the SMEs' increasingly technology- and environment-sensitive stakeholders and to improve their reputation. Originality/value: This study provides the first empirical evidence that ethical data privacy management has a positive impact on the reputation of firms. Furthermore, the originality of the research derives from the analysis of the results from an environmental perspective. Indeed, this study shows that effective data privacy management can indirectly support organisational reputation through eco-innovation and green skills. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Data privacy practices;

Box 2713, Doha, Qatar","Online reviews play a significant role in shaping consumer purchase decisions. Accordingly, emergence of fake reviews has proliferated as an instrument to manipulate customers’ buying preferences. Such manifestation, however, lacks theoretical grounding and remains under researched due to two notable challenges: first, absence of conceptual underpinnings between consumers’ writing style and recommendation behavior. Second, little knowledge about the role of product characteristics underlying fake reviews and their influence on nudging product preferences. Through the lens of environmental psychology, this study uses an empirical investigation utilizing natural language processing (NLP) to uncover latent product-specific features underlying customer reviews and their impact on persuading buying preferences. As a major finding, we observe that characteristics underlying fake reviews, as opposed to genuine ones, fail to influence product recommendation or discouragement. Accordingly, we suggest firms permitting fake reviews on their portals to be aware of the limited economic advantages of such practices. © 2023, The Author(s).",E-commerce; Online reviews; Product discouragement; Product recommendation; Purchase decisions; Review manipulation; Text mining,Consumer behavior; Fake detection; Natural language processing systems; Purchasing; Sales; Buying decisions; Consumer purchase; Online reviews; Product characteristics; Product discouragement; Product recommendation; Purchase decision; Review manipulation; Text-mining; Writing style; Electronic commerce,,,,,,,"Aghakhani N., Oh O., Gregg D., Jain H., How review quality and source credibility interacts to affect review usefulness: an expansion of the elaboration likelihood model, Information Systems Frontiers, (2022); Akter S., Wamba S.F., Gunasekaran A., Dubey R., Childe S.J., How to improve firm performance using big data analytics capability and business strategy alignment?, (2016); Akter S., Fosso Wamba S., Dewan S., Why PLS-SEM is suitable for complex modelling?

Specifically, the key topics and the sentiments of privacy assurances, the aspects of brand trust referred, and the privacy policy-brand trust reference relationship were explored. A total of 62 privacy policy statements on the websites of the 100 leading companies in the e-commerce industry worldwide were analyzed using quantitative content, sentiment, and Spearman's correlation analyses. Results indicate that most of the leading companies in the global e-commerce sector share information about various privacy practices positively. Although the most valuable e-commerce international brands tend to have a higher level of the online brand privacy policy, they are less likely to refer to brand trust. However, online brand privacy policy and online brand trust reference levels are not found to be significantly associated.

Currently, research on digital fashion is focused on the transformation of enterprise marketing strategies and the discussion of digital technology. Despite this, the current study does not include an analysis of the audience’s emotional and cognitive responses to digital fashion on social networking platforms. A comprehensive analysis and discussion of 52,891 posts about digital fashion and virtual fashion published on social networking sites was conducted using k-means clustering analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, and sentiment analysis in this study. The study examines the public’s perception and hot topics about digital fashion, as well as the industry’s development situation and trends. According to the findings, both positive and neutral emotions accompany the public’s attitude toward digital fashion. There is a wide range of topics covered in the discussion. Innovations in digital technology have impacted the creation of jobs, talent demand, marketing strategies, profit forms, and industrial chain innovation of fashion-related businesses. Researchers in related fields will find this study useful not only as a reference for research methods and directions, but also as a source of references for research methodology. A case study and data reference will also be provided to industry practitioners.

At present, in order to compete for passengers, various preferential marketing strategies emerge in endlessly, but only marketing products that meet the needs of passengers can really get the favor of passengers. Cluster analysis can realize customer segmentation, while the traditional K-means algorithm is widely used because of its simple algorithm, fast calculation speed and low requirements for hardware. However, the selection of K value cannot be accurately grasped, and the random selection of clustering center and other shortcomings are also prominent. Based on this, this paper improves the traditional K-means algorithm. Han-kmeans algorithm is proposed, and experiments prove that Han-Kmeans algorithm has higher clustering accuracy. Finally, this paper subdivides aviation industry customers through the improved algorithm, and puts forward targeted marketing strategies for different types of customers. © 2022 IEEE.",Air traveler; Bigdata; Clusteranalysis; Customer segmentation; K-means,Air transportation; Cluster analysis; Commerce; Sales; Strategic planning; Air travellers; Airline industry; Bigdata; Clusteranalyse; Customers segmentations; ITS applications; K-mean algorithms; K-means; Marketing strategy; Optimisations; K-means clustering,,,,,"Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong, (2019GGX104095, 2019GSF111054); Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of Shandong Province, (2019JZZY010120)","This work was financially supported by the Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province under Grant No. 2019GSF111054 and No. 2019GGX104095, Major Science and Technology Innovation Project of Shandong Province under Grant No. 2019JZZY010120","Yang J., Chen L., Zhou Q., Chen J., Journal of Nanjing Normal University (Natural Science edition), 44, 2, pp. 10-17; Xiaoxia Z., Cao J., Zhao Q., Application of clustering algorithm in image segmentation [J], Journal of Xinzhou Normal University, 37, 2, pp. 24-27; Xiuling Z., Application of K-means algorithm in campus one-card platform [J], Journal of Information And Record Materials, 22, 4, pp. 77-78; Xiao L., Xiaoli W., Research on Airline Customer Value Classification based on K-Means and Neighborhood Rough Set [J], Operations Research and Management, 30, 3, pp. 104-111; Di C., Liu J., Journal of Nanjing University (Natural Science), 57, 2, pp. 177-188; Kaili L., Research on Inaccurate Supervised Learning Methods and Its Application [D], (2020); Yangjun D., Wang N., Research on the application of Air passenger value segmentation based on K-means Algorithm [J], Information Technology and Informatization, 11, pp. 31-33, (2020); Xi Z., Yi S., Jing H., Jieqing N., Research and application of refined oil customer precision marketing based on customer clustering [J], Petroleum planning and design, 31, 6, pp. 35-39+62, (2020); Cong Shi H., Optimization of K-means clustering algorithm and its application in precision marketing of e-commerce platform [D], (2020); Yuanhang R., Review of k-means algorithm for big data [J], Application research of computers, 37, 12, pp. 3528-3533, (2020); Congshi H., Xujian L., Research on improved k-means algorithm [J], Software, 41, 3, pp. 21-23, (2020); Ling-Ling X., Shu-Lian Z., Xin Z., Information & computer (theory edition), 31, 23, pp. 109-110, (2019); Yuwei S., Airline Customer Classification and Loss Prediction [D], (2019); Ting G., Huijie P., Jiawei Z., Haochen W., Research on air passenger clustering based on k-means [J], Value engineering, 37, 35, pp. 52-54, (2018); Si'An C., Wang X.X., Electronic Technology and Software Engineering, 17, pp. 155-156, (2018); Yangzhi H., Airline Customer value Analysis Based on K-means Clustering Method [J], Communications World, 7, pp. 303-305, (2018); Congcong Z., Research on Aviation Industry Customer Segmentation based on Spark Platform [D], (2017); Qianqian Y., Jiagen S., Haitian Z., Application of k-means clustering algorithm in civil aviation customer segmentation [J], Electronic design engineering, 23, 12, pp. 25-27, (2015); Shengfa C., Ruiyu J., Improved K-medoids algorithm based on Canopy density weight [J], Computer engineering and science, 41, 10, pp. 1823-1828, (2019); Congshi H., Gaoyu Z., Xi Z., Mingzhao Z., Gongpeng S., Information Technology and Informatization, 5, pp. 132-133, (2021)","H.

This whole process is known as customer relationship management (CRM). In this context, we extensively surveyed 138 papers published between 1996 and 2021 in the area of analytical CRM. Although this study consisted of papers from different business sectors, a fair share of focus was directed to the telecommunication industry and generalized CRM techniques usages. Different science and engineering-based data repositories were studied to ascertain significant studies published in scientific journals, conferences, and articles. The research works on CRM were considered and separated into IT and non-IT-based techniques to study the methods used in different business sectors. The main target behind implementing CRM is for the better revenue growth of the company. Different IT and non-IT-based techniques are used in the analytical CRM area to achieve this target, and researchers have been actively involved in this domain. The purpose of the research was to show the impact of IT-based techniques in the business world. A detailed future course of research in this area was discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on this, the urgent problem is to retain customers and predict the outflow of customer base by switching subscribers to the services of competitors. Data Science technologies and data mining methodology create significant opportunities for companies that implement data analysis and modeling for development of customer churn prediction models. The research goals are to compare different approaches and methods for customer churn prediction and construct different Data Science models to classify customers according to the probability of their churn from the company's client base and predict potential customers who could stop to use the company's services. On the example of one of the leading Ukrainian telecommunication companies, the article presents the results of different classification models, such as C5.0, KNN, Neural Net, Ensemble, Random Tree, Neural Net Ensemble, etc. All models are prepared in IBM SPSS Modeler and have a high level of quality (the overall accuracy and AUC ROC are more than 90%). So, the research proves the possibility and feasibility of using models in the further classification of customers to predict customer loyalty to the company and minimize consumer’s churn. The key factors influencing the customer churn are identified and form a basis for future prediction of customer outflow and optimization of company’s services. Implementation of customer churn prediction models will help to maintain customer loyalty, reduce customer outflow and increase business results © 2022 Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

Applications of social media analytics (SMA) have become common practice in marketing and are employed to predict consumer behavior. However, critical reflections on SMA applications to nonprofit marketing are lacking, despite the increased usage of SMA by nonprofit organizations. Objective: The article proposes to apply SMA to analyze UGC and identify how computational methodologies can help bolster strategic communication for nonprofit organizations and drive marketing strategy. Methodology: The article presents results from a 2-year (October 2017–January 2020) social media monitoring of the hashtag #DownSyndrome on Twitter and Instagram. SMA tools will be used. Specifically, sentiment analysis and topic modeling are employed to analyze tweets and Instagram posts, while image classification is used to analyze Instagram images. Findings: The results highlight a strong stereotypical characterization of people with Down syndrome in content that is generated by social media users and identify possibilities and challenges ahead of nonprofit organizations pushing specific agendas. Originality and Contribution: This study is the first to offer a review of SMA, apply them to a nonprofit context and reflect on aspects of representation and stereotypization through them. It ultimately proposes to support nonprofit and voluntary marketing research and practice by integrating UGC research and computational techniques into the broader discussion of ethical content strategy in social media nonprofit marketing. © 2022 The Authors.

Besides, other customers consider online hotel scores an efficient tool for quickly evaluating the quality of hotels’ services. Therefore, a higher online score indicates customer satisfaction and would lead to more bookings, price acceptance, and higher financial performance. In this article, we extracted the shortcomings related to hotel attributes utilizing a novel methodology that comprises machine learning algorithms, text mining, and a combination of customers’ comments and scores. Then we examined the quantitative effect of fixing these problems on hotels’ online scores. Furthermore, considering the origin of the problems, the cost required for fixing them, and the quantitative effect of solving them on improving the hotels’ online scores, we provided some prescriptions for hotel managers as the last phase of business analytics. This model and its resulting prescriptions can be used to increase hotels’ online scores significantly by improving service quality at the lowest cost. Finally, to describe the most important attributes, we used The Nordic European School of thought and classified them based on the technical and functional dimensions of Grönroos’ service quality model. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",hospitality management; machine learning; natural language processing; online customer reviews; prescriptive analytics; service quality,,,,,,,,"Aggarwal S., Gour A., Peeking inside the minds of tourists using a novel web analytics approach, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 45, pp. 580-591, (2020); Albayrak T., Caber M., Prioritisation of the hotel attributes according to their influence on satisfaction: A comparison of two techniques, Tourism Management, 46, C, pp. 43-50, (2015); Ali F., Amin M., Cobanoglu C., An integrated model of service experience, emotions, satisfaction, and price acceptance: An empirical analysis in the Chinese hospitality industry, Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management, 25, 4, pp. 449-475, (2016); Amado A., Cortez P., Rita P., Moro S., Research trends on big data in marketing: A text mining and topic modeling based literature analysis, European Research on Management and Business Economics, 24, 1, pp. 1-7, (2018); Ananth M., DeMicco F., Moreo P., Howey R., Marketplace lodging needs of mature travelers, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 33, 4, pp. 12-24, (1992); Anderson C.K., The impact of social media on lodging performance, (2012); Anderson S.W., Baggett L.S., Widener S.K., The impact of service operations failures on customer satisfaction: Evidence on how failures and their source affect what matters to customers, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 11, 1, pp. 52-69, (2009); Araque O., Corcuera-Platas I., Sanchez-Rada J.F., Iglesias C.A., Enhancing deep learning sentiment analysis with ensemble techniques in social applications, Expert Systems with Application, 77, pp. 236-246, (2017); Assaf A.G., Magnini V.P., Accounting for customer satisfaction in measuring hotel efficiency: Evidence from the us hotel industry, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 31, 3, pp. 642-647, (2012); Au N., Buhalis D., Law R., Complaints on the online environment — the case of hong kong hotels, Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2009, pp. 73-85, (2009); Babakus E., Mangold W.G., Adapting the servqual scale to hospital services: an empirical investigation, Health services research, 26, 6, (1992); Baka V., The becoming of user-generated reviews: Looking at the past to understand the future of managing reputation in the travel sector, Tourism Management, 53, pp. 148-162, (2016); Banerjee S., Bhattacharyya S., Bose I., Whose online reviews to trust?

However, little is known about the function of cultural factors that can outline the effectiveness of digital advertising practices to alter attitude and consumer behavior toward clothing brands. This research examines how norm-congruent attitudes toward digital advertising (hereafter ADA) may operate as a process variable that mediates the relationship between perception about digital advertising (hereafter PDA) and online purchase intention of fashion brands (hereafter OPI). We propose a gender egalitarianism (hereafter GE)-moderated mediation model whereby ADA mediates the relationships between PDA and OPI in two culturally diverse nations: Malaysia and Pakistan. The model was tested by using 2 (GE appeal: present vs. absent) × 2 (nation: Pakistan vs. Malaysia) × 2 (no exposure to ads/exposure to ads) experimental design with data obtained from a sample of 260. Findings show that there is a significant difference in the relationship between PDA and OPI that is mediated by the attitude in both nations. However, the mediation implication of the attitude is significantly dependent on the interaction of the GE. In this way, the study provides some practical recommendations for the marketers by highlighting the salient advertising features that may be more useful in both nations. © 2021 by the authors.

E-commerce is a process of allowing people to buy and sell products online using electronic medium. E-commerce has a wide range of customer base as well. The data generated through transaction helps the enterprises to develop the marketing strategy. The growth of this e-commerce application depends on several factors. Some of the factors are follows 1) Customer demand, 2) Analyzing buying pattern of the users, 3) Customer retention, 4) dynamic pricing etc. It is very difficult to analyze the buying pattern of customers as there is a wide range of customer base in the online platform. To overcome this problem, this research study discusses about the challenges and issues in e-commerce applications, also identifies and analyses the buying patterns of customer using various machine learning techniques. From the implementation it is identified that, KNN algorithm performed well while comparing it with various other machine learning algorithms. Performances of these algorithms have been analyzed using various matrices. For analyzing, the model is tested using e-commerce dataset (Amazon dataset downloaded from Kaggle.com). From the analysis it found that KNN algorithm computes and predicts better compared to other machine learning algorithms either Naïve Bayes, or Random Forest, or Logistic Regression etc.  © 2023 IEEE.",buying behavior; Consumer behavior analysis; E- Commerce applications; K-Nearest Neighbor; Machine Learning,Barium compounds; Electronic commerce; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Sales; Behavior analysis; Buying behavior; Buying patterns; Consumer behavior analyse; Customerbase; E-Commerce applications; Electronic medium; K-near neighbor; Machine-learning; Nearest-neighbour; Consumer behavior,,,,,,,"Wang Z., Li M., Lu J., Cheng X., Business Innovation based on artificial intelligence and Blockchain technology, Information Processing & Management, 59, 1, (2022); Lissitsa S., Kol O., Generation X vs. Generation Y-A decade of online shopping, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 31, pp. 304-312, (2016); Ray S., A Quick Review of Machine Learning Algorithms, 2019 International Conference on Machine Learning, Big Data, Cloud and Parallel Computing (COMITCon), pp. 35-39, (2019); Taunk K., De S., Verma S., Swetapadma A., A Brief Review of Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for Learning and Classification, 2019 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICCS), pp. 1255-1260, (2019); Xing W., Bei Y., Medical Health Big Data Classification Based on KNN Classification Algorithm, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 28808-28819, (2020); Zhang S., Li X., Zong M., Zhu X., Wang R., Efficient kNN Classification With Different Numbers of Nearest Neighbors, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 29, 5, pp. 1774-1785, (2018); Li Y., Fang B., Guo L., Chen Y., Network anomaly detection based on TCMKNN algorithm, Proceedings of the 2nd ACM symposium on Information, computer and communications security (ASIACCS '07), pp. 13-19, (2007); Li N., Kong H., Ma Y., Et al., Human performance modeling for manufacturing based on an improved KNN algorithm, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 84, pp. 473-483, (2016); Moldagulova A., Sulaiman R.B., Using KNN algorithm for classification of textual documents, 2017 8th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT), pp. 665-671, (2017); Zhang S., Li X., Zong M., Zhu X., Wang R., Efficient kNN Classification With Different Numbers of Nearest Neighbors, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 29, 5, pp. 1774-1785, (2018); NirmalaDevi M., Alias Balamurugan S.A., Swathi U.V., An amalgam KNN to predict diabetes mellitus, 2013 IEEE International Conference ON Emerging Trends in Computing, Communication and Nanotechnology (ICECCN), pp. 691-695, (2013); Deng Z., Zhu X., Cheng D., Zong M., Zhang S., Efficient kNN classification algorithm for big data, Neurocomputing, 195, pp. 143-148, (2016); Ullah I., Raza B., Malik A.K., Imran M., Islam S.U., Kim S.W., A Churn Prediction Model Using Random Forest: Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques for Churn Prediction and Factor Identification in Telecom Sector, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 60134-60149, (2019); Cui H., Huang D., Fang Y., Liu L., Huang C., Webshell Detection Based on Random Forest-Gradient Boosting Decision Tree Algorithm, 2018 IEEE Third International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace (DSC), pp. 153-160, (2018); Zhang J., Chen C., Xiang Y., Zhou W., Xiang Y., Internet Traffic Classification by Aggregating Correlated Naive Bayes Predictions, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 8, 1, pp. 5-15, (2013); Soualhi A., Medjaher K., Zerhouni N., Bearing Health Monitoring Based on Hilbert-Huang Transform, Support Vector Machine, and Regression, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 64, 1, pp. 52-62, (2015); Prasetio D., Harlili D., Predicting football match results with logistic regression, 2016 International Conference On Advanced Informatics: Concepts, Theory And Application (ICAICTA), pp. 1-5, (2016)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"3rd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Social Networking, ICPCSN 2023",19 June 2023 through 20 June 2023,Salem,193140.0,,979-835032284-2,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The latter is currently trendy, both in academia and industry, and is used to describe a wide range of concepts, from data extraction, storage, and management, to data processing and analysis using well-known schemas, to extract patterns in hidden relationships in order to make better decisions and to derive new knowledge using analytical techniques and solutions. The technology that enables the potential of big data to be exploited is called “Big Data Analytics”. Big data analytics is a major challenge that enables researchers, analysts and business users to make better decisions faster. Big Data became an important part of marketing research and marketing strategies. The e-commerce industry is one of the industries that currently benefits most from the potential of big data collection and analysis. This paper therefore aims to demonstrate the use of big data to understand customers and to improve and facilitate the decision making process. In this research, we apply multiple machine learning (ML) models on large dataset present in the e-commerce area by studying several practical cases on online markets. © 2021.

Business-to-Customer (B2C) e-commerce has considerably increased the use of AI in recent years. The purpose of this research is to examine the significance and impact of AI in the realm of fashion e-commerce. To that end, a systematic review of the literature is carried out, in which data from the Web Of Science and Scopus databases were used to analyze 219 publications on the subject. The articles were first categorized using AI techniques. In the realm of fashion e-commerce, they were divided into two categories. These categorizations allowed for the identification of research gaps in the use of AI. These gaps offer potential and possibilities for further research. © 2023 by the authors.",AI; business-to-customer; fashion; retail,,,,,,"Basque Universities, (IT1582-22); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2021-128969OB-I00)","This work has been supported by DEUSTEK5– Human-centric Computing for Smart Sustainable Communities and Environments, Basque Universities’ System’s research group, with code IT1582-22.

Responsible consumption has also been considered by households and individuals, and interest in sustainable products has positively evolved. Although sustainable products have more and more been considered by consumers and producers as appropriate alternatives, the results are still underwhelming. This study aims to demonstrate the relationship between the online sales of sustainable products and the online marketing costs expressed by the cost-per-click in Romania in the last three years. This quantitative research is a conclusive and descriptive study based on secondary data sets collected from the evidence registered in an online agency, which, in turn, was based on a sample of companies and products in three industries considered highly open to sustainable approaches: electronics; home and garden; clothing and footwear. The results show different relationships between the online marketing cost and the sales of sustainable products in the above-mentioned industries. In addition, online consumer purchasing intention is a mediator for the relationship between marketing cost and online sales in one industry only, namely electronics. The study reveals the development of the online transactions of sustainable products, considering the connection between marketing costs and subsequent sales. © 2022 by the authors.",COVID-19 pandemic; e-commerce; online consumer purchasing intention; online marketing; online sales; sustainable products,Romania; COVID-19; electronic commerce; marketing; psychology; sustainability,,,,,,,"Ghandour A., Ecommerce website value model for SMEs, Int.

This study uses empirical model to relate consumer characteristics with IP product purchase. The results show that consumers shopping on weekends are more likely to buy IP products, and consumers who have stocking behavior are less likely to purchase IP products. Consumers who are members of the retailer also have lower probability to buy IP products. These findings provide suggestions for the retailers who want to apply differentiation strategy by introducing co-branded IP products. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The findings highlight the differences between Chinese-speaking tourists and English-speaking tourists regarding the four attributes the tourists focus on when choosing an Airbnb: the host, accommodation, location, and price. The results suggest that Chinese-speaking tourists are generally more positive and objective than English-speaking tourists when writing online reviews. The former have a more positive perception of the host but are more selective than the latter regarding the other three attributes.

To the best of the author’s knowledge, there is no study to discuss the impact of customer-centric retailing on total supply chain profit under price competition between organized and unorganized retailers. Design/methodology/approach: This paper considers a supply chain comprising of organized and unorganized retailers and a single manufacturer. This paper proposes three mathematical models considering a customer-centric approach in a competitive environment. Stackelberg game is used to examine how members of the chain interact, and Nash equilibrium was used to find optimal strategies for players under different customer-centric approaches. Findings: The results show that the total supply chain profit is higher when both organized and unorganized retailers use a customer-centric approach independently instead of collaborating process. The result, in addition, establishes that when the dissatisfying cost exceeds a certain threshold (1.5), the total profit is higher for the organized customer-centric effort model compared to the other two models. Originality/value: The main contribution of the study is to examine the effect of customer-centric retailing, considering dissatisfying costs on supply chains profit and individual decision-making under price competition between organized retailers and unorganized retailers. The authors developed different mathematical models in the different customer-centric approach. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Customer-centric approach; Organized and unorganized retailers; Price competition; Retail supply chain,,,,,,,,"Adrodegari F., Saccani N., A maturity model for the servitization of product-centric companies, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 31, 4, pp. 775-797, (2020); Agrawal N., Smith S.A., Retail Supply Chain Management: Quantitative Models and Empirical Studies, 223, (2015); Allen A.M., Brady M.K., Robinson S.G., Voorhees C.M., One firm’s loss is another’s gain: capitalizing on other firms’ service failures, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 43, 5, pp. 648-662, (2015); Aminoff A., Hakanen T., Implications of product-centric servitization for global distribution channels of manufacturing companies, International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 48, 10, pp. 1020-1038, (2018); Anand N., Grover N., Measuring retail supply chain performance: theoretical model using key performance indicators (KPIs), Benchmarking: An International Journal, 22, 1, pp. 135-166, (2015); Anderson E.W., Customer satisfaction and word of mouth, Journal of Service Research, 1, 1, pp. 5-17, (1998); Arnold S.J., Lessons learned from the world’s best retailers, International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management, 30, 11, pp. 562-570, (2002); Azer J., Facebook from socializing to advertising: an empirical study on the effect of Facebook as an advertising tool, African Journal of Business Management, 9, 24, pp. 796-813, (2015); Azer J., Alexander M., Negative customer engagement behaviour: the interplay of intensity and valence in online networks, Journal of Marketing Management, 36, 3-4, pp. 361-383, (2020); Baines T., Lightfoot H., Made to Serve.

Different information sources have the potential to positively enhance students’ decision quality through different levels of utilization. This research investigated the influence of online environment quality on international students’ decision quality, and whether information quality (IQ) of the online environment predicts information-task fit (ITF), perceived usefulness and decision quality. The data used for this study was gathered from first- and second-year international students (N = 308) at different universities across six countries. A structural equation modelling approach revealed the significant influence of online environment quality on the decision quality of international students’ university choice through the mediating perceptions of two levels of utilization, ITF and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, the moderating roles of website type and source type showed the significantly different influences of IQ on students’ decision quality. Implications for HE researchers and marketers in improving the online environment quality and marketing are provided. © The Author(s) 2021.",decision quality; information quality; information-task fit; international students; online content environment; perceived usefulness; social influence; university choice,,,,,,,,"Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Aksakalli V., Optimizing direct response in internet display advertising, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 11, 3, pp. 229-240, (2012); Alfattal E., International students’ college choice is different!, International Journal of Educational Management, 31, 7, pp. 930-943, (2017); Anderson J., Gerbing D., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Bentler P.M., Bonett D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures, Psychological Bulletin, 88, 3, pp. 588-606, (1980); Bonilla M., Perea E., Olmo J., Et al., Insights into user engagement on social media.

Firms also have demands to find customers’ information from large datasets and to understand how to develop marketing strategies accurately to adjust their operational methods. Therefore, this study proposed customer ranking combined big data process based on the RFM model (recency, frequency, monetary) to develop a recommendation algorithm using an association rule, which finds greater recommendation to promote operational effects of firms. The authors adjust the weight of potential information to perform the customer ranking, which is conducted by using agglomerate hierarchical clustering. Finally, they present the recommendation by the association rule for each customer level.

Versions 1.6.16 and 64.0.4 of the VOS viewer and R Studio are employed to analyze the data. The proposed strategy incorporates a visual component to demonstrate the conceptual development of the research field. Firstly, motor patterns, niche patterns, emerging or declining patterns, and basic pattern themes of EAA study using a strategic map. Secondly, it allows us to assess and illustrate the thematic evolution of a study field from 2001 to 2021. Identifying the different themes is accomplished by using co-word analysis over time. Lastly, it also analyses the co-citation networks of authors for documents. In science mapping, co-citation analysis assumes that works cited together are connected thematically. The analysis is also employed to reveal a study field's intellectual structure. The e-commerce apparel attribute data are grouped into three clusters using these co-citation networks. This study examines the literature and identifies emerging topics and future research directions. Another aspect of this study that reveals the intellectual underpinnings of the research is co-citation analysis or network analysis of research publications. Additionally, this study offers insights into managing apparel e-commerce websites. Future researchers can benefit from co-citation analysis, thematic analysis, and the evolution of themes. © 2023, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

E-commerce is at the forefront of transforming marketing strategies, based on new technologies, and facilitates product information and improved decision-making. In this way, marketing strategy increasingly require large amounts of information to better understand client needs, which raises the question of choosing the right marketing strategy to better fit consumer expectations. This literature review aims to shed light on both the recent growth of e-commerce literature and its interplay with consumer marketing strategy. Extant research has examined this change in human interaction due to social network building, mostly through the themes of online marketing and social media marketing, also comprehending issues such as cost efficiency, information quality and trust development towards online shopping. Nevertheless, existing research has not shown in full all the research streams, how they interact with each other and its potential knowledge development. Thus, a literature review on consumer marketing strategy for e-commerce in the last decade is opportune. This paper aims to identify research trends in the field through a Systematic Bibliometric Literature Review (LRSB) of research on marketing strategy for e-commerce. The review includes 66 articles published in the Scopus® database, presenting up-to-date knowledge on the topic. The LRSB results were synthesized across current research subthemes. The following findings are presented: Amidst the current competitive global business environment, companies tend to respond with strategies for e-commerce and online businesses that resort to e-commerce platforms and social networking to better understand consumer needs, facilitate consumer marketing strategy and share innovative information. The originality of the paper relies on its LRSB method, together with extant review of articles that have not been categorized so far. © 2021 by the authors.

Since 2012, Zara has been working on a plan to close, restructure, and optimize its physical shops, a process that was accelerated in 2017, and which has been affected by the global pandemic that began in early 2020. These two events have caused online sales to exponentially rise with, in turn, the percentage of returns.

Market segmentation is a widely used approach in investigating the heterogeneity of customer buying behavior and profitability. It is important to note that conventional market segmentation models in the retail industry are predominantly descriptive methods, lack sufficient market insights, and often fail to identify sufficiently small segments. This study also takes advantage of the dynamics involved in the Hadoop distributed file system for its ability to process vast dataset. Three different market segmentation experiments using modified best fit regression, i.e., Expectation-Maximization (EM) and K-Means++ clustering algorithms were conducted and subsequently assessed using cluster quality assessment. The results of this research are twofold: i) The insight on customer purchase behavior revealed for each Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) segment; ii) performance of the clustering algorithm for producing accurate market segments. The analysis indicated that the average lifetime of the customer was only two years, and the churn rate was 52%. Consequently, a marketing strategy was devised based on these results and implemented on the departmental store sales. It was revealed in the marketing record that the sales growth rate up increased from 5% to 9%. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Many large retail brands try to keep their client base interested by becoming partners in cashback websites. These websites are based on a specific type of affiliate marketing whereby customers access a wide range of merchants and obtain financial rewards based on their activities. Besides using this mix of traditional marketing strategies, cashback websites attract new target customers and increase existing customers’ loyalty through recommendations, using a word-of-mouth marketing strategy built on economic incentives for users who refer others to these sites. The literature shows that this strategy is one of the major areas of success of this business model because customers who join following recommendation are more active and are therefore more profitable and loyal to the brand. Nevertheless, the new users who are referred to these sites vary considerably in terms of the number of transactions they make on the site. This study advances research on the design of recommendation-based digital marketing strategies by providing companies with a predictive model. This model uses data science, including machine learning methods and big data, to personalize financial incentives for users based on the quality of the new customers they refer to the cashback website. Companies can thus optimize and maximize the return on their marketing investment. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",62; 68; 91; Artificial neural network; Cashback; E-commerce;

Traffic tracking and analysis tools can help businesses know more about their customers. These tools track visitors' behaviors on Web sites. The information obtained from Web traffic tracking and analysis can help online merchants target specific audiences with customized products and services. Most commonly used approaches include Web log file, packet monitors, and single-pixel image approach. Each of these approaches has some drawbacks, which limits the types of data it can track or the user environment. In this paper, we propose a tracking and analysis approach, which has fewer limitations and more advantages than the existing approaches. We discuss three different approaches (i.e., improved single-pixel image, JavaScript tracking and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) proxy server), which work together to track a user's activities. In addition to basic analysis, we implement advanced analysis such as path analysis tree and user clustering. Path analysis is pivotal for Web site management and marketing in e-commerce. In modeling the tracking and analysis approach, we used a formal technique to guide quality assurance imperatives. © 2020 The Authors.",Data mining; Packet monitors; Personalization and recommendation systems path analysis tree; Single-pixel image; Traffic tracking and analysis; Web log files,,,,,,,,"Ehikioya S.A., Lu S., A path analysis model for effective e-commerce transactions, Afr.

A comprehensive set of SGCs were identified through an exploratory qualitative study (study 1) to reflect each source credibility dimensions (ie. expertise, trustworthiness, attraction and co-orientation), and were later adopted in a quantitative study (study 2) to test robust nature of the conceptual framework of source credibility and its impact on users' actual repost behavior when incentives are presented to them. Data indicate that by holding expected reward and perceived cost constant, all dimensions of source credibility were found to have significant main effects on repost behavior, with no interaction. Number of friends to @ was found to be inversely related to repost behavior. Implications of these findings are discussed, along with limitations of the current study and directions for future research. © 2018 California State University, Long Beach.",Microblog rewarding reposts; Online advertising; Social media; Source credibility; System generated cues,,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Zhejiang University, ZJU","This work was supported by grant No. 71471163 from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and partly supported by the special grant of research and development for liberal arts teachers of Zhejiang University.

Marketing strategies can be acclimatized to offer more viably to the vital segment of buyers by engaging e-mavens, their antecedents of big five personality traits, frugality, and sustainable consumption behavior are needed to comprehend. The study assessed the novel endeavor to exhibit a potential relationship among the big five, e-mavenism, frugality, and sustainable consumption behavior in social networking sites. This body of knowledge adds to comprehend sustainable consumption behavior and fills many gaps by using data from a sample (n = 387) of social networking sites users from China. Causal modeling technique (SEM) is affianced to evaluate the study hypotheses. The data from an online survey disclose a positive association of agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness to experience with e-mavenism. The results affirm that e-mavenism is positively correlated with frugality. Moreover, frugality is vital in the growth of sustainable consumption behavior as well. Eventually, e-mavenism positively influences sustainable consumption behavior. These results enhance understanding of sustainable consumption behavior and provide an opportunity that marketing managers may apply these constructs into their strategies to achieve competitive advantage. © 2020 by the authors.",E-mavenism; Frugality; Social network sites; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable consumption behavior; The big five,China; consumption behavior; marketing; modeling; social network,,,,,"Department of Data Science and Engineering Management, School of Management; Zhejiang University, China","This research received no external funding.

From the conceptualizations, we provide a definition of IoT and present its implications and impact on future research in Marketing that interfaces with information systems, design and innovation, data science and cybersecurity, as well as organizational studies and economics.

These approaches are expected to be particularly important for highly customized industries because the diversity of products sold makes it harder to find clear patterns of customer preferences. The goal of this project was to investigate two different data mining approaches for customer segmentation: clustering and subgroup discovery. The models obtained produced six market segments and 49 rules that allowed a better understanding of customer preferences in a highly customized fashion manufacturer/e-tailor. The scope and limitations of these clustering DM techniques will lead to further methodological refinements. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.,Clustering; Customized manufacturing; Fashion industry; Segmentation; Subgroup discovery,Commerce; Image segmentation; Manufacture; Sales; Clustering; Customer preferences; Customer segmentation; Fashion industry; Large database; Market segment; Subgroup discovery; Data mining,,,,,"National Strategic Reference Framework; QREN, (2012/24708, 2012/24708-NORTE-07-0124-FEDER-000057); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (260169); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (NORTE-07-0124-FEDER-000059)","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007) Agreement no.

Applied in many domains, such as e-commerce, health, marketing, software development, and system design, personas have remained relatively unchanged for several decades. However, with the increasing popularity of digital user data and data science algorithms, there are new opportunities to progressively shift personas from general representations of user segments to precise interactive tools for decision-making. In this vision, the persona profile functions as an interface to a fully functional analytics system. With this research, we conceptually investigate how data-driven personas can be leveraged as analytics tools for understanding users. We present a conceptual framework consisting of (a) persona benefits, (b) analytics benefits, and (c) decision-making outcomes. We apply this framework for an analysis of digital marketing use cases to demonstrate how data-driven personas can be leveraged in practical situations. We then present a functional overview of an actual data-driven persona system that relies on the concept of data aggregation in which the fundamental question defines the unit of analysis for decision-making. The system provides several functionalities for stakeholders within organizations to address this question. © 2020 Bernard J.

This motivated the researchers to compete in building models to maximize CLV and consequently, enhancing the firm, and the customer relationship. This review paper analyzes the contributions of applying dynamic programming models in the area of direct marketing, to maximize CLV. It starts by reviewing the basic models that focused on calculating CLV, measuring it, simulating, optimizing it or -rarely- maximizing its value. Then highlighting the dynamic programming models including, Markov Decision Process (MDP), Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), also called Reinforcement Learning (RL), Deep RL and Double Deep RL. Although, MDP contributed significantly in the area of maximizing CLV, it has many limitations that encouraged researchers to utilize ADP (i.e. RL) and recently deep reinforcement learning (i.e. deep Q network). These algorithms overcame the limitations of MDP and were able to solve complex problems without suffering from the curse of dimensionality problem, however they still have some limitations including, overestimating the action values. This was the main motivation behind proposing double deep Q networks (DDQN). Meanwhile, neither DDQN nor the algorithms that outperformed it and overcame its limitations were applied in the area of direct marketing and this leaves a space for future research directions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP); Customer Lifetime Value (CLV); Deep Q Network (DQN); Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL); Markov Decision Process (MDP); Reinforcement Learning (RL),Commerce; Deep learning; Intelligent systems; Machine learning; Markov processes; Public relations; Reinforcement learning; Sales; Value engineering; Approximate dynamic programming; Customer lifetime value; Deep Q Network (DQN); Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL); Markov Decision Processes; Dynamic programming,,,,,,,"Abdolvand N., Albadvi A., Koosha H., Customer lifetime value: Literature scoping map, and an agenda for future research, Int.

Companies outsource various activities, which enable them to improve efficiency, reduce costs, focus more on core competencies and improve their innovation capabilities. Supply Chain Management synchronizes the efforts of all parties-particularly suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, dealers, customers-involved in achieving customer's needs. Despite much research, the relationship between customer loyalty and the supply chain strategy remains insufficiently explored and understood by practitioners and academics, while the theme has been extensively developed within marketing literature. Customer Loyalty and Supply Chain Management is the result of years of work by the authors on different projects concerning the overlapping areas of supply chains, logistics and marketing, drawing a connection between the literature to provide a holistic picture of the customer loyalty framework. Emphasis is given to the B2B context, where recent research has provided some clues to support the fact that investment in operations, new technologies and organizational strategy have had a significant role in understanding B2B loyalty, particularly in the context of global supply chains. Moreover, the book provides a modernized and predictive model of B2B loyalty, showing a different methodological approach that aims at capturing the complexity of the phenomenon. This book will be a useful resource for professionals and scholars from across the supply chain who are interested in exploring the dimension of customer loyalty in the challenging supplier and customer context. © 2017 Ivan Russo and Ilenia Confente.

Recommender systems also help these companies in cross-selling, up-selling and to increase the customer loyalty. However, presence of certain users, known as gray sheep users, with eccentric taste, minimizes the overall efficiency of the recommender systems. Hence, their identification and removal from the computation system is critical for more efficient recommendations. This work presents psychographic models-based approaches for gray sheep user identification with improved performance. It also studies gray sheep behavior across different domains and contexts, apart from introducing the idea of gray sheep items. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Collaborative Filtering; Context Aware Recommender Systems; Cross Domain Recommender Systems; Gray Sheep Users; Personalization; Psychographic models,Ovis aries; consumption behavior; electronic commerce; marketing; product development; retailing,,,,,,,"Adamopoulos P., Todri V., (2015); Adomavicius G., Tuzhilin A., Context-aware recommender systems, Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 217-253, (2011); Adomavicius G., Tuzhilin A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: a survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions, IEEE Trans.

Nevertheless, the impact of BDA capabilities on a firm's performance is still not fully understood. These capabilities relate to the flexibility of the BDA infrastructure and the skills of the management and the firm's personnel. Most scholars explored the phenomenon from either a theoretical standpoint or neglected intermediate factors, such as organizational traits. This article builds on the dynamic capabilities view to propose and empirically test a model exploring whether organizational ambidexterity and agility mediate the relationship between BDA capabilities and organizational performance. Using data from surveys of 259 managers of large European organizations, we tested a proposed model using bootstrapped moderated mediation analysis. We found that organizational BDA capabilities affect a firm's ambidexterity and agility, which, in turn, affect its performance. These results establish ambidexterity and agility as positive mediators in the relationship between organizational BDA capabilities and a firm's performance. Furthermore, the organizational resistance to the implementation of information management systems and the fit between the organization and these systems also moderated this relationship. Practical implications for managers are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Agility; Ambidexterity; Big data; Big Data Analytics (BDA); Management information systems; Organizational performance,Europe; Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data Analytics; Human resource management; Management information systems; Managers; Agility; Ambidexterity; Dynamic capabilities; Information management systems; Mediation analysis; Organizational performance; bootstrapping; data set; empirical analysis; numerical model; organizational framework; performance assessment; Information management,,,,,,,"Akter S., Wamba S.F., Gunasekaran A., Dubey R., Childe S.J., How to improve firm performance using big data analytics capability and business strategy alignment?, Int.

Despite the widespread use of social media and online communities, empirical studies investigating the economic value of user-generated content (UGC) and marketer-generated content (MGC) still lag behind. The purpose of this paper is to contribute both theoretically and practically to capture both first-order effects and second-order effects of internet celebrity endorsements on marketing outcomes in an e-commerce context. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts a cross-sectional regression to evaluate the economic value of internet celebrity endorsement, and a panel vector autoregressive model is adopted to examine the relationship between celebrities’ and consumers’ content marketing behaviors and e-commerce sales performance. The authors also adopt look-ahead propensity-score matching technique to correct for selection bias. Findings: The empirical results show that the content generation efforts of marketers and the interaction behaviors between marketers and consumers will significantly influence the e-commerce sales, which refers to the first-order effects of internet celebrity endorsement. Moreover, interactions within the fan community exert second-order effects of content marketing on sales performance. Originality/value: This paper provides new insights for e-commerce retailers to evaluate the economic values of internet celebrity endorsement, a new content marketing practice in e-commerce platform. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Content marketing; E-commerce sales; Interaction behaviours; Internet celebrity economy; Internet celebrity endorsement,Consumer behavior; Media streaming; Sales; Social networking (online); Celebrity endorsements; Content marketings; Cross-sectional regression; Design/methodology/approach; Interaction behaviours; Propensity score matching; User generated content (UGC); Vector autoregressive model; Electronic commerce,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71821001, 71902152, 91546107); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (19YJC630042); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LR16G020001)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 91546107, 71821001 and 71902152), the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (No. LR16G020001) and MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (No. 19YJC630042).

It evolves the business logic of online ad-delivery from buying “ad-impressions” in websites or ad slots to directly buying the best-matched “target audiences”, and thus can help advertisers achieve the precision marketing. As a critical part of RTB advertising markets, Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) play a central role in matching advertisers with their target audiences via cookie-based data analysis and market segmentation, and their segmentation strategies (especially the choice of granularity) have key influences in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of RTB advertising markets. Based on a mathematical programming approach, this paper studied DSPs’ strategies for market segmentation, and established a selection model of the granularity for segmenting RTB advertising markets. With the computational experiment approach, we designed three experimental scenarios to validate our proposed model, and the experimental results show that: 1) market segmentation has the potential of improving the total revenue of all the advertisers; 2) with the increasing refinement of the market segmentation granularity, the total revenue has a tendency of a rise first and followed by a decline; 3) the optimal granularity of market segmentation will be significantly influenced by the number of advertisers on the DSP, but less influenced by the number of ad requests. Our findings show the crucial role of market segmentation on the RTB advertising effect, and indicate that the DSPs should adjust their market segmentation strategies according to their total number of advertisers. Our findings also highlight the importance of advertisers as well as the characteristics of the target audiences to DSPs’ market segmentation decisions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Computational experiment; Demand Side Platforms; Market segmentation; Real Time Bidding,Big data; Computation theory; Data handling; Economics; Information analysis; Marketing; Mathematical programming; Advertising markets; Computational advertisings; Computational experiment; Demand-side; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Market segmentation; Precision marketings; Real time; Commerce,,,,,"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, SBUMS",This study was finacially supported by Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences .,"Bergemann D., Bonatti A., Targeting in advertising markets: implications for offline versus online media, The RAND J.

Digital marketing strategies are formulated by the marketing teams in order to increase the traffic on their e-commerce sites, thereby boosting the sales of the products. With the massive amount of data available from the cloud, which were conventionally made with a high degree of intuition based on decision makers’ knowledge and experience, can now be supported with the application of artificial intelligence techniques. This paper introduces a novel approach in applying the fuzzy association rule mining approach and the fuzzy logic technique, for discovering the factors influencing the pricing decision of products launched in e-commerce retail site, and in formulating flexible, dynamic pricing strategies for each product launched in an e-commerce site. A pricing decision support system for B2B e-commerce retail businesses, namely Smart-Quo, is developed and implemented in a Hong Kong-based B2B e-commerce retail company. A six-month pilot run reveals a significant improvement in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness in making pricing decisions on each product. The case study demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of applying artificial intelligence techniques in marketing management in today’s digital age. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",artificial intelligence;

In addition, it reviews different participation responses (likes, comments, and shares) to build systematic image and theme modules that detail planning require-ments for community information. The sample includes luxury fashion brands (Chanel, Hermès, and Louis Vuitton) and fast fashion brands (Adidas, Nike, and Zara). Using a web crawler, a total of 21,670 posts made from 2011 to 2019 are obtained. A fashion brand image model is constructed to determine key image cues in posts by each brand. Drawing on the findings of the ensemble analysis, this research divides cues used by the six major fashion brands into two modules, image cue module and image and theme cue module, to understand participation responses in the form of likes, comments, and shares. The results of the systematic image and theme module serve as a critical reference for admins exploring the characteristics of public participation for each brand and the main factors motivating public participation. © 2021 by the author.

In spite of the mounting body of research on big data across the social science disciplines, scholars have offered little synthesis on the current state of knowledge. To take stock of academic research that contributes to the big data revolution, this paper tracks scholarly work's perspectives on big data in the management domain over the past decade. We identify key themes emerging in management studies and develop an integrated framework to link the multiple streams of research in fields of organisation, operations, marketing, information management and other relevant areas. Our analysis uncovers a growing awareness of big data's business values and managerial changes led by data-driven approach. Stemming from the review is the suggestion for research that both structured and unstructured big data should be harnessed to advance understanding of big data value in informing organisational decisions and enhancing firm competitiveness. To discover the full value, firms need to formulate and implement a data-driven strategy. In light of these, the study identifies and outlines the implications and directions for future research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Big data; Literature review; Management research,Information management; Business and management; Data-driven approach; Integrated frameworks; Literature reviews; Management domains; Management research; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Science disciplines; Big data,,,,,,,"Abrahams A., Fan W., Wang G., Zhang Z., Jiao J., An integrated text analytic framework for product defect discovery, Prod.

In order to build a loyal customer base, a company needs to deploy various marketing strategies focused on the diverse nature of its customers. We propose a model, abbreviated as RFMOC, based on extension of recency frequency, monetary (RFM) analysis with two new variables to segment customers. The model also studies the segmentation performance for the k-means clustering algorithm. Moreover, customer lifetime value (CLV) is calculated for the weighted RFMOC with weights for variables calculated by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and customer segments are then ranked accordingly which helps to create targeted marketing strategies. At last, the customer churn prediction is performed using logistic regression by further extending the RFMOC with one more variable, abbreviated as RFMOCD, in order to predict the churning behaviour of the customers. The proposed approach is helpful to assess customer loyalty and to manage customer relationships in an effective manner. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Churn prediction; Customer segmentation; E-commerce; Online shopping,Analytic hierarchy process; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Forecasting; K-means clustering; Logistic regression; Public relations; Strategic planning; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Customer churn prediction; Customer lifetime value; Customer relationships; Customer segmentation; Marketing strategy; Segmentation performance; Targeted marketing; Sales,,,,,,,"Khodabandehlou S., Zivari Rahman M., Comparison of supervised machine learning techniques for customer churn prediction based on analysis of customer behavior, J.

With customer-driven industries becoming highly competitive, there is a huge demand for efficient business intelligence (BI) approaches to facilitate high performance results while optimising on the costs invested, mainly in marketing activities. Therefore, researchers around the world are exploring BI techniques to maximise customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Recently, machine learning models are being adopted to guide businesses for investing on new marketing strategies through intelligent mining of their existing customer data. This paper adopts a neural network approach to analyse and develop a model of business rules establishing relationships that can exist between customer demographics and the final purchase made by the customers. Then this model can be employed for the prediction of the purchasing patterns that might occur in the future. The dataset obtained from Kaggle's 'Allstate Purchase Prediction challenge' consisting of a car insurance customer base is employed for developing our prediction model. The experimental results confirm that the neural network approach adopted is able to extract the purchasing rules exhibited by the customers of a firm by discovering the customer behaviour patterns and their relationships with different demographic variables. An efficient prediction of the customer purchasing patterns would help organisations to make appropriate business proposals to their prospective customers in order to achieve higher customer satisfaction. © 2019 IEEE.",Customer demographics; Customer satisfaction; Feature classification; Machine Learning; Neural Networks; Prediction model,Commerce; Customer satisfaction; Forecasting; Population statistics; Public relations; Customer demographics; Customer relationship management; Demographic variables; Efficient predictions; Machine learning models; Marketing activities; Marketing strategy; Prospective customers; Sales,,,,,,,"Ganesh J., Arnold M.J., Reynolds K.E., Understanding the customer base of service providers: An examination of the differences between switchers and stayers, Journal of Marketing, 64, pp. 65-87, (2000); Chinmoy B., When customers are members: Customer retention in paid membership contexts, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science-J ACAD MARK SCI, 26, pp. 31-44, (1998); Werner R., Werner Kumar V., On the profitability of long-life customers in a noncontractual setting: An empirical investigation and implications for marketing, Journal of Marketing, 64, pp. 17-35, (2000); Sivarajah U., Kamal M.M., Irani Z., Weerakkody V., Critical Analysis of Big Data Challenges and Analytical Methods, (2017); Joly Y., Burton H., Knoppers B.M., Feze I.N., Dent T., Pashayan N., Chowdhury S., Foulkes W., Hall A., Hamet P., Kirwan N., Macdonald A., Simard J., Hoyweghen I.V., Life insurance: Genomic stratification and risk classification, European Journal of Human Genetics, (2014); Sharmila S., Suvasini P., Detection of automobile insurance fraud using feature selection and data mining techniques, International Journal of Rough Sets and Data Analysis, 5, pp. 1-20, (2018); Joudaki H., Rashidian A., Minaei-Bidgoli B., Mahmoodi M., Geraili B., Nasiri M., Arab M., Improving fraud and abuse detection in general physician claims: A data mining study, International Journal of Health Policy and Management, 5, 3, pp. 165-172, (2016); Nian K., Zhang H., Tayal A., Coleman T.F., Li Y., Auto insurance fraud detection using unsupervised spectral ranking for anomaly, The Journal of Finance and Data Science, 2, pp. 58-75, (2016); Fan C., Wang W., A comparison of underwriting decision making between telematics-enabled UBI and traditional auto insurance, Adv Manag Appl Econ, 7, pp. 17-30, (2017); Schafer J.G., Konstan J.A., Riedl J., E-Commerce Recommendation Applications, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 5, pp. 115-153, (2001); Lariviere B., Poel D.V., Predicting customer retention and profitability by using random forests and regression forests techniques, Expert Syst.

In the current literature, it is often used for recognizing different deal-sensitive levels of customers and is common in customer relationship management. To capture its dynamic change, this research develops a two-phase ensemble of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) model, Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the first phase, several clusters are identified by integrating the RFM model with K-means method. In the second phase, the number of clients is predicted in each cluster using a GA-LSTM model where the GA optimizes the structure of LSTM model. The experimental results demonstrate that customer segments with different characteristics can be identified. The proposed GA-LSTM model can be used for finding optimal parameters under certain conditions and improving prediction robustness. © Proceedings of the 2020 IISE Annual.

This is true within domestic markets, but especially so for increasingly global corporations, as shareholder pressure for continued growth drives businesses into ever more widespread geographical markets. Arguing that more complex markets demand more sophisticated spatial analysis, this book discusses the application of location planning techniques to generate competitive advantage in a variety of business sectors in a changing retail environment. The series of techniques are analysed, from relatively straightforward branch scorecards to sophisticated applications of geographical information systems (GIS), spatial modelling and mathematical optimisation. Also explored are the changing dynamics of the impact of more restrictive planning environments in many countries on how retailers find new locations for growth and respond to changing consumer needs and wants. The book is essential reading for students and scholars alike working in geography, economics, business management, planning, finance and industry studies. © 2017 Mark Birkin, Graham Clarke and Martin Clarke.",nan,,,,,,,,"Alexander N., Doherty A.M., International retailing, (2009); Alon I., Qi M., Sadkowski R., Forecasting aggregate retail sales: A comparison of artificial neural networks and traditional methods, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 8, pp. 147-156, (2001); Amcoff J., The geographical redistribution of retail outlets in Sweden 1998-2008, The International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research, 26, 3, pp. 242-259, (2016); Apparicio P., Cloutier M.S., Shearmur R., The case of Montreal’s missing food deserts: Evaluation of accessibility to food supermarkets, International Journal of Health Geographics, 6, 1, (2007); Applebaum W., Guidelines for a store location strategy study, Journal of Marketing, 30, pp. 42-55, (1966); Arentze T.A., Oppewal H., Timmermans H.J.P., A multipurpose shopping trip model to assess retail agglomeration effects, Journal of Marketing Research, 109, pp. 109-115, (2005); Ashby D., Longley P., Geocomputation, geodemographics and resource allocation for local policing, Transactions in GIS, 9, pp. 53-72, (2005); Ashworth G., Tunbridge J.E., The tourist-historic city, (1990); Aspinall P.J., Estimating the size and composition of the lesbian, gay and bisexual population in Britain.

The proposed method is developed for the first time in the context of tourism and hospitality by this research, especially for customer segmentation in green hotels through customers' online reviews. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for cluster analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) technique for analyzing textual reviews, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking hotel features, and Neuro-Fuzzy technique to reveal the customer satisfaction levels. The impact of green hotels with spa and non-spa services on travelers' satisfaction is investigated for four travelling groups: Travelled solo, Travelled with family, Travelled as a couple and Travelled with friends. The proposed method is evaluated on the travelers' reviews on 152 hotels in Malaysia. The findings of this study provide an important method for travelers' decision-making for hotel selection through User-Generated Content (UGC) and help hotel managers to improve their service quality and marketing strategies. © 2019 by the authors.",Big data; Green hotels; Machine learning techniques; Multi-criteria decision-making; Neuro-fuzzy; Satisfaction; Sustainable development; TOPSIS,Malaysia; cluster analysis; data mining; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; machine learning; multicriteria analysis; numerical model; service quality; sustainable development; World Wide Web,,,,,"Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Sichuan Province, (LYC18-02, Xq18A01); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771156, 71971145)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71771156 and 71971145, and the 2018 Key Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Sichuan Province, grant number Xq18A01 and LYC18-02","Rahman I., Reynolds D., The influence of values and attitudes on green consumer behavior: A conceptual model of green hotel patronage, Int.

Although the RFM model has been widely applied in various areas of marketing, its simplicity threatens its effectiveness since it does not consider the customers' relationship and changes in customers' behavior. In this paper, we propose an R+FM model which configures the segmentation according to the business changes and clusters customers using K-Means. We applied our model on Digikala company, the biggest E-Commerce in Middle East, and compared our model with the Digikala's previous RFM model which used Customer Quantile Method. Moreover, we built strategies for each segment and ran an SMS campaign according to those strategies. The results of the campaign showed that our Segmentation Model improved the number of purchase and average monetary of the baskets. © 2018 IEEE.",CRM; Cutomer Segmentation; E-Commerce; K-Means; RFM,Behavioral research; Decision making; Electronic commerce; K-means clustering; Planning; Sales; Business changes; Customer segmentation; Effective analysis; K-means; Marketing strategy; Segmentation models; Strategy development; User behavior analysis; Data mining,,,,,,,"Aggelis V., Christodoulakis D., Rfm analysis for decision support in e-banking area, WSEAS Transactions on Computers, 4, 8, pp. 943-950, (2005); Aghdaie M.H., Tafreshi P.F., A New Perspective on Rfm Analysis, pp. 1-20, (2017); Brynjolfsson E., Hu Y., Simester D., Goodbye pareto principle, hello long tail: Modeling and measuring the effect of search cost on product sales distribution, Workshop on Information Systems and Economics (WISE, (2005); Chang H.-C., Tsai H.-P., Group rfm analysis as a novel framework to discover better customer consumption behavior, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 12, pp. 14499-14513, (2011); Cox N.J., Transformations: An Introduction, (2007); Dursun A., Caber M., Using data mining techniques for profiling profitable hotel customers: An application of rfm analysis, Tourism Management Perspectives, 18, pp. 153-160, (2016); Han S.H., Lu S.X., Leung S.C., Segmentation of telecom customers based on customer value by decision tree model, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 4, pp. 3964-3973, (2012); He Y., Lin C., Gao W., Wong K.-F., Dynamic joint sentiment-topic model, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST, 5, 1, (2013); Hosseini S.M., Maleki A., Gholamian M.R., Cluster analysis using data mining approach to develop crm methodology to assess the customer loyalty, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 7, pp. 5259-5264, (2010); Hu Y.-H., Yeh T.-W., Discovering valuable frequent patterns based on rfm analysis without customer identification information, Knowledge-Based Systems, 61, pp. 76-88, (2014); Hughes A.M., Strategic database marketing: The masterplan for starting and managing a profitable, Customer-based Marketing Program, 12, (2000); Kaymak U., Fuzzy target selection using rfm variables, IFSA World Congress and 20th NAFIPS International Conference, 2, pp. 1038-1043, (2001); Kim S.-Y., Jung T.-S., Suh E.-H., Hwang H.-S., Customer segmentation and strategy development based on customer lifetime value: A case study, Expert Systems with Applications, 31, 1, pp. 101-107, (2006); Kracklauer A.H., Mills D.Q., Seifert D., Customer Management As the Origin of Collaborative Customer Relationship Management, pp. 3-6, (2004); Miglautsch J.R., Thoughts on rfm scoring, Journal of Database Marketing & Customer Strategy Management, 8, 1, pp. 67-72, (2000); Namvar M., Gholamian M.R., KhakAbi S., A two phase clustering method for intelligent customer segmentation, Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation (ISMS), 2010 International Conference on, pp. 215-219, (2010); Phan D.D., Vogel D.R., A model of customer relationship management and business intelligence systems for catalogue and online retailers, Information & Management, 47, 2, pp. 69-77, (2010); Ravasan A.Z., Mansouri T., A fuzzy anp based weighted rfm model for customer segmentation in auto insurance sector, Intelligent Systems: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications, pp. 1050-1067, (2018); Wei J.-T., Lee M.-C., Chen H.-K., Wu H.-H., Customer relationship management in the hairdressing industry: An application of data mining techniques, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 18, pp. 7513-7518, (2013); Wei J.-T., Lin S.-Y., Weng C.-C., Wu H.-H., A case study of applying lrfm model in market segmentation of a childrens dental clinic, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 5, pp. 5529-5533, (2012); Wu J., Lin Z., Research on customer segmentation model by clustering, Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Electronic Commerce, pp. 316-318, (2005); Wu R.-S., Chou P.-H., Customer segmentation of multiple category data in e-commerce using a soft-clustering approach, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 10, 3, pp. 331-341, (2011)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"15th International Conference on e-Business Engineering, ICEBE 2018",12 October 2018 through 14 October 2018,Xi'an,144172.0,,978-153867992-0,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

But instead of reaching its maturity stage, relationship marketing is nowadays encountering its next upsurge. Due to a confluence of trends driving the global business world—including the transition to service-based economies, faster product commoditization, intensified competition worldwide, growth among emerging markets, aging populations, advertising saturation, and (above all) the digital age—strong customer relationships are more than ever vital to company strategy and performance. Relationship Marketing in the Digital Age provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art of relationship marketing, offering fruitful insights to marketing scholars and practitioners. In seven chapters, divided into two main sections on understanding (Part I) and effectively applying (Part II) relationship marketing, an introductory and a concluding chapter, readers learn how to successfully manage customer–seller relationships. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",nan,,,,,,,,"Developers to Invest $2.5 Billion in Augmented Reality in 2018; Look for Enterprise to Drive Smart Glasses, (2013); Adjei M.T., Noble S.M., Noble C.H., The influence of c2c communications in online brand communities on customer purchase behavior, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 5, pp. 634-653, (2010); Get the Most out of Cyber Monday Deals Week, (2018); Arora S., Hofstede F.T., Mahajan V., The implications of offering free versions for the performance of paid mobile apps, Journal of Marketing, 81, 6, pp. 62-78, (2017); Barney J.B., Clark D.N., Resource-Based Theory: Creating and Sustaining Competitive Advantage, (2007); Barney J.B., Hesterly W.S., Strategic Management and Competitive Advantage: Concepts and Cases, (2012); Bartels R., The Development of Marketing Thought, (1962); Becker H.S., Doing Things Together: Selected Papers, (1986); Benedicktus R.L., Brady M.K., Darke P.R., Voorhees C.M., Conveying trustworthiness to online consumers: Reactions to consensus, physical store presence, brand familiarity, and generalized suspicion, Journal of Retailing, 86, 4, pp. 322-335, (2010); Berry L.L., Relationship marketing, Emerging Perspectives on Services Marketing, pp. 25-28, (1983); Berry L.L., Relationship marketing of services-growing interest, emerging perspectives, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 23, 4, pp. 236-245, (1995); Biesdorf S., Court D., Willmott P., Big Data: What’s Your Plan?, (2013); Binder C., Hanssens D.M., Why strong customer relationships trump powerful brands, Harvard Business Review Online, (2015); Blystone D., Understanding Alibaba’s Business Model, (2015); Brandt M., Internet of Things Wird Bis 2020 Alltaglich, (2014); Brinker S., Marketing Technology Landscape Supergraphic (2018): Martech 5000 (Actually 6,829); Brown M., Airbnb: The Growth Story You Didn’t Know, (2014); Gerichtshof B., Bundesgerichtshof erkennt Schadensersatz fur den Ausfall eines Internetanschlusses zu, (2013); Digital Age, (2018); Mobile Share Exceeded 80% in China Online Shopping Market in Q2 2017, (2017); The World Factbook: Median Age, (2018); Cialdini R.B., Rhoads K.V.L., Human behavior and the marketplace, Journal of Marketing Research, 13, 3, pp. 8-13, (2001); Columbus L., 2014: The Year Big Data Adoption Goes Mainstream in The Enterprise, (2014); Dahl D., Honea H., Manchanda R.V., The nature of self-reported guilt in consumption contexts, Marketing Letters, 14, 3, pp. 159-171, (2003); Dahl D., Honea H., Manchanda R.V., Three rs of interpersonal consumer guilt: Relationship, reciprocity, reparation, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 15, 4, pp. 307-315, (2005); Daimler, Daimler Trucks—A True, Global Player’, (2012); Day G.S., Aligning the organization with the market, MIT Sloan Management Review, 48, 1, pp. 41-49, (2006); DesMarais C., The New Booming Market?

As the volume growth, several operational logistics challenges appear, mainly related to providing proper service levels which meet consumer expectations. The exploration of consumer behavior data to perform predictive analysis stands out as an option for overcoming logistic difficulties.

We used the association rule to identify product associations, the clustering technique to group shippers and consignees according to behaviors when receiving goods from similar shipper groups, and the decision tree to identify possible matches between shippers and consignees. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate potential revenue. The case study is a courier company in Thailand. The results showed that garment products and clothes were the products with the highest association. Shippers and consignees of these products were segmented according to recency, frequency, monetary factors, number of customers, number of product items, weight, and day. Three rules are proposed that enabled the assignment of 8 consignees to 56 shippers with an estimated increase in revenue by 36%. This approach helps decision-makers to develop an effective cost-saving new marketing, inclusive strategy quickly. © 2020 by the authors.",Association rule; Clustering technique; Courier service; Decision tree; Recommendation system,,,,,,"E-LSCM; Chiang Mai University, CMU; Thailand Research Fund, TRF, (PHD58I0068)","Acknowledgments: This work was supported by the Thailand Research Fund (TRF) under Grant No. PHD58I0068 and Excellence Center in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (E-LSCM), Chiang Mai University.","Linden G., Smith B., York J., Amazon. com recommendations: Item-to-item collaborative filtering, IEEE Internet Comput, 7, pp. 76-80, (2003); Chajri M., Fakir M., Application of Data Mining in e-Commerce, J.

Therefore, analyzing potential upgrades in the security process and adopting them in a way that does not impact passenger experience has become a key activity for airport managers. One viable technological solution that is not only effective but also efficient is biometric security. This technology allows for passengers to safely clear security based on their unique biometric features. Despite its promise, airports and passengers alike are slow to adopt its use. Additionally, there were few studies that revealed insights into passengers' intentions toward repeat use of biometric security. Hence, in our novel attempts to uncover the underlying reasons, we implemented a study on passengers' initial and repeat usage intention based on perceived benefits and risks of biometric security technology. Based on 327 survey responses, we employed the use of SEM to extract first-and second-order constructs before evaluating our hypotheses on a finally accepted model. To be aligned with the novel attempt of this research, the results showed that both the perceived benefits and risks have a significant impact on passenger's initial and repeat use intention of biometric security. Therefore, for all practitioners engaged in sustainable airport management, strong consideration from this research should help in creating value for passengers while mitigating the risks of adopting biometric security within airport security settings. © 2020 by the authors.",Biometrics; Passenger intention; Perceived benefit; Perceived risk; Repeat use; Sustainable airport management,air transportation; airport; biometry; hypothesis testing; national security; perception; public attitude; risk assessment; technology adoption,,,,,,,"Lee J.H., Study on future airport security screening, Korea Civ.
